### DKI Compliance Threshold Logic – Written in Plain English

**1. Operating Jurisdiction:**

* All cases are conducted under Oklahoma jurisdiction.
* CLEET (Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training) sets the operating rules.
* DKI is legally accountable to those rules in every case.

**2. Subcontractor Boundaries:**

* Any subcontractor must hold their own license.
* They contract TO DKI, not FROM DKI.
* DKI must retain proof of:

  * Their license
  * Contractual relationship
  * Work scope

**3. Silent Compliance Monitor (SCM):**

* SCM operates in the background of every case.
* If something is found that is illegal (like wiretap, phone record access, or unauthorized tracking):

  * It is automatically flagged internally.
  * That data is blocked from inclusion in any output.
  * Report will still show as complete but will NOT contain illegal content or be verified by client sourcing (verified evidence must be supplied as supporting documentation)
* SCM leaves an internal log entry, not visible to clients.

**4. Evidence From Client:**

* Any evidence provided by the client:

  * Must be labeled as CLIENT-PROVIDED.
  * Will be allowed only if there is support:

    * Either metadata
    * Or case documentation
    * Or photo/video context
* DKI is NOT liable for how the client obtained that evidence.

**5. Legal Matching:**

* The system uses keyword similarity (like how lawyers search law databases) to match any questionable phrases.
* It compares those to a list of banned or restricted activities.
* If any match is found, it:

  * Flags it
  * Logs it
  * Blocks it from appearing in the final report

**6. Reporting Label:**

* If the report passes all compliance checks:

  * A final tag is added: “COMPLIANT / CLEET VALIDATED.”
  * This is for internal archiving only.

**7. Future Ability (Optional):**

* If connected to a live law source (like Oklahoma statutes), the system could one day:

  * Cross-check every action with the law
  * Reject anything out of bounds in real time
  * Act as a legal buffer for PI liability

8. All sorcing must be pulled from all available open source available search criteria (google, yahoo, reddit, ect) 

   * all sources oare to be verified as usable information but not a source of legal admisability 
   * we are not lawyers, attorneys, or officers of the legal court system and therefor it is required that you check with a registered officer of the court for final decesion and legal authority compliance.
