# Section 6: Surveillance Operations Billing Logic (English-Based Framework)

## Purpose

This logic governs how all surveillance-related billing is extracted, verified, and documented. It ensures transparent invoicing based on verified field work, while remaining compliant with client contracts and operational policies.

---

## Data Sources & Anchor Points

Surveillance operations billing is drawn from four cross-referenced sections of the investigation report:

1. **Section 3: Daily Logs**

   * Logs actual hours in the field
   * Records departure, contact, and return times
   * All logs are considered primary billing data

2. **Section 4: Surveillance Sessions**

   * Provides narrative justification for all field activities
   * Describes subject sightings, engagement, or inactivity
   * Used to support the time entries in Section 3

3. **Section 2: Pre-Surveillance Strategy**

   * Defines contracted hours and surveillance goals
   * Establishes the max allowable hours for fieldwork before overages

4. **Pre-Investigation Costs Section**

   * Confirms deductions from the \$500 planning budget
   * Remaining funds affect the field operations billing pool

---

## Surveillance Fieldwork Budget

* Calculated as:
  **Contracted Total – \$500 (Planning Budget)**

* All planning/report costs above \$500 (if any) are also subtracted from this total

---

## Billable Time Rules

* **Hourly Rate**: \$100/hour

* **Billable Time Categories**:

  1. **Pre-Surveillance Travel**: Always 30 minutes
  2. **Post-Surveillance Travel**: Always 30 minutes
  3. **Time In Field**: Based on logs, metadata, and narrative

* **Reconnaissance Time**:

  * Time used to verify subject location or prepare area
  * Listed separately and not included in main field hours billing
  * Still shown for transparency, especially when contracted time is exceeded

---

## Validation & Audit Integrity

* All time must:

  * Be logged in Section 3
  * Match GPS metadata, when available
  * Be supported by visual/narrative evidence in Section 4
  * Stay within strategy window unless separately noted as "Recon"

* If conflict is detected (e.g., hours billed without evidence):

  * Flag entry
  * Trigger internal Q\&A protocol

* If no surveillance occurred:

  * Only travel and planning time are billed
  * Fieldwork total may be zero

---

## 24-Hour Format & Strategic Retroactive Adjustment

* **Time Format**: All time values in this section use a **24-hour clock** to:

  * Reduce interpretive confusion
  * Cleanly reflect full surveillance shifts
  * Allow seamless addition of the pre/post travel billing time

* **Authorized Edits (Only Section in Report)**:

  * This section is the **only location** that permits retroactive edits
  * Edits may adjust Section 3 and Section 4 logs to apply +/- 30 min billing rule
  * All adjustments must be:

    * Justified internally and authorized in accordance with defined billing adjustment parameters
    * Adjusted in both Section 3 and 4 equivocally for congruent time stamps
    * Synced with billing validation logic

* This allows the report to undergo **a single integrity edit pass** post-final review

---

## Surveillance Audit Protocol

* Compare reported time in Section 3 and Section 4 against:

  * Metadata timestamps
  * Field location anchors
  * Travel patterns from the investigator business location

* **Calculate Total Hours Claimed vs. Total Hours Verified**

  * Use metadata and narrative validation
  * Adjust only the in/out times to align with the standard billing model
  * Apply +30 minutes pre, +30 minutes post rule if supported

* **Example Correction**:

  > Section 3 and Section 4 Report: 3 Days, 18 Hours
  >
  > Retroactive Audit: Edits only the time in and the time out in both sections, the exact same using 24-hour time format
  > Audit Shows: Validated Metadata Supports 3 Days, 21 Hours
  > Final Report Value: 21 Hours (Billing Adjusted)

* Corrections are silent to the client but logged internally

---

## Summary Statement Format (for report)

> **Subtotal – Surveillance Fieldwork Budget**: \[Contract - \$500 - report overages]
> **Actual Billed Hours**: \[Verified hours from Sections 3 & 4, post-adjustment]

---

## Internal Mileage Handling (Hidden from Client)

* Mileage is always tracked
* Public-facing statement remains:

> *"Mileage was waived as a professional courtesy."*

Mileage is validated using:

* Photo/Video metadata (location/time)
* Route logic from investigator's base to surveillance area

If subcontractor charges mileage:

* DKI verifies and passes actual cost to client, without markup
* Internal buffer used if cost appears inflated

---

## Result

A clean, court-defensible, client-facing billing section:

* Validated against 4 layers of evidence
* Reflects true operational engagement
* Remains fair, compliant, and transparent
* Strategically permits a one-time final edit for billing continuity and legal resilience

**Post-Retroactive Edit Lock and Validation Protocol (English Logic)**

Once retroactive billing edits have been performed within the Surveillance Operations section, the system enters a locked state to prevent any further automated or manual changes to billable time entries or their timestamps. This lock is permanent unless explicitly overridden by an authorized administrator with logged justification.

**System Lock Activation Criteria:**

* All edits applied to Section 3 and Section 4 timestamps must be:

  * Matched across both sections (start and end times)
  * Reflected in 24-hour format
  * Justified based on travel rules (+/- 30 minutes)
  * Supported by metadata and visual evidence
* Once these edits are finalized, the system automatically:

  * Disables future adjustments to those fields
  * Stores a timestamped audit log of the changes
  * Flags the entry as "Post-Audit Locked"

**Reverse Continuity Test (Triggered Upon Lock):**
Immediately following the lock, a reverse continuity validation sequence is triggered. This test ensures all surveillance time entries are logically and chronologically consistent across:

* Section 2: Pre-Surveillance Strategy (contracted hours and goals)
* Section 3: Daily Logs (field times)
* Section 4: Surveillance Sessions (narrative match to time claims)
* Section 6: Final Billing Summary (time and value congruence)

**Continuity Test Requirements:**

* Anchor points must align (start/end, GPS, metadata)
* All billed hours must be traceable to both narrative and logs
* Calculations in billing summary must match confirmed field times
* Any discrepancy results in a flagged audit for internal review

This sequence ensures the integrity of the report, prevents billing manipulation, and maintains legal defensibility across the finalized surveillance billing process.

Internal Mileage Handling 

Mileage is always tracked

Public-facing statement remains:

"Mileage was waived as a professional courtesy."

Mileage is validated using:

Photo/Video metadata (location/time)

Route logic from investigator's base to surveillance area

If subcontractor charges mileage:

DKI verifies and passes actual cost to client, without markup

Internal buffer used if cost appears inflated

RETAINER SUMMARY (Final Value Calculation Table)

This is the last section in the billing summary and functions as the final aggregation and calculation point for all preceding financial data.

Retainer Logic

Contracted Amount Due: Pulled from client intake form and signed contract

Total Retainer Applied: Cross-checked with Section 1

Remaining Balance After Planning

Contracted total minus $500 planning

If no surveillance was performed, return $0.00

Deductions

$500 for surveillance planning (if used)

Documentation flat fee ($100.00)

Pre-investigation costs (actual total from planning deductions)

Total Cost of Investigation

Sum of all billing subsections (pre-investigation, surveillance, documentation)

Remaining Retainer Balance

Contracted amount minus investigation total

Final Statement

Total Remaining Balance Owed (if any) or declare "Zero if nothing is owed"

All fields are auto-populated and validated through prior sections. If conflict is detected (e.g., costs exceed contract but billing doesn’t reflect this), the entry is flagged and sent to internal review.
