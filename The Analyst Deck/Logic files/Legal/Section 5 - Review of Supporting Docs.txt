Section5Logic:
  description: "Standard logic for processing and formatting supporting documents in private investigation case reports."
  core_rules:
    - All submitted documents must be included in the report unless legally restricted.
    - Photos or image files are not listed in this section unless officially classified as records (e.g., government-archived satellite maps).
    - Documents must be grouped under generalized but legally sound categories.
    - Document categories must be jurisdiction-neutral and repeatable across reports.
    - Documents must be described by record type and jurisdiction, not by original file name.
    - All records must be attributed to a named subject in Last name, First name format.
    - Intake forms and contracts must always appear as the final category in this section.
    - Document lists must maintain clean left-aligned formatting with consistent indentation.
    - Final report is client-facing and must contain a complete listing of obtained material for legal transparency and discovery standards.
  enforcement:
    - Records without names or dates trigger Q&A resolution.
    - Redundant file names are stripped.
    - All jurisdiction labels must follow this format: "[County/State/Department] Records"
    - Supporting documentation chain is validated through intake trace and document timestamp.
    - If a document proves irrelevant, erroneous, or mismatched (e.g., wrong subject), it must be:
        - flagged for review,
        - submitted to admin for removal consideration,
        - removed only upon documented approval with justification.
