**NEW REPORT LOGIC STRUCTURE ‚Äî SECTION 1 FOCUS**

---

**1. Report Type Logic Switch (Section 1)**

Section 1 is the primary filter for the report system. It establishes the core case identity and anchors logic decisions for the remainder of the report. It does **not** change structurally but controls how the rest of the report behaves.

---

### üìç What Section 1 *Is*:

* The **investigative objective statement** of the case
* The **fixed form** that collects client information, subjects, goals, and objectives
* A direct reflection of both the **client intake form** and the **signed contract**

### üîí Structure:

* This section's **headings, labels, and fillable fields** are static and must not be altered.
* The report engine does not reformat or suppress this section under any condition.

---

### üîÅ Section 1 as a Logic Filter

Section 1 drives all downstream decisions based on two core anchors:

1. **Contract Type**
2. **Client Intake Needs**

From these, the system identifies:

* The **type of investigation** (Investigative, Field, Hybrid)
* The **report structure** required
* The **billing model** to apply
* Whether any modules should be suppressed or remain active

---

### üß† Logic Flow Mapping:

| Logic Filter Element      | Source             | Triggers                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract Type             | Signed Contract    | Determines report mode: Investigative, Field, Hybrid              |
| Case Objective            | Client Intake Form | Populates Section 1 and anchors context for billing and structure |
| Type of Subject           | Intake + Contract  | Activates subject profile modules if needed                       |
| Presence of Field Work    | Contract Clause    | Triggers Field or Hybrid reporting                                |
| Prepaid Reporting Clauses | Contract           | Triggers or suppresses \$500 planning logic                       |

---

### üß± Filter Outcome ‚Äî Report Mode Selection

Based on data in Section 1, the system applies the following logic switch:

* **If** contract is research-only and no field clause is present ‚Üí **Investigative Report Mode**
* **If** contract is surveillance-only and no investigative support is listed ‚Üí **Field Report Mode**
* **If** both clauses exist or case escalates mid-process ‚Üí **Hybrid Report Mode**

This selection determines:

* Active sections and headings
* Billing logic rules (hourly vs flat)
* Suppressed modules
* Export formatting and summaries

---
‚úÖ Client Stack Logic ‚Äî Clean Rule

One client = One client block

Even with multiple contracts, the client data (name, address, contact) is singular and static.

üîí Why This Matters

Prevents duplication in report rendering

Avoids conflicts in metadata mapping

Ensures uniform address, phone, and signature fields across contracts

Supports cleaner YAML, billing continuity, and logic switches

üß† System Behavior:

If multiple contracts from the same case reference the same client (April Roberts, in this case), the system should:

Use the first occurrence (or latest signed intake) to anchor the client data

Ignore redundant client data in other contracts unless it conflicts, in which case it triggers a conflict resolution alert

---

Subject Stack Logic Rules
‚úÖ 1. Accept Multiple Subjects

Support for Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Subjects

All subjects must be listed in Section 1

üß† 2. Mapped to Shared Investigation Objective

Each subject is connected to the same case goal

System assumes the investigation is collective unless contracts specify isolated objectives

üìÑ 3. Output Behavior

Section 1 lists all subjects

Section 3 and 4 should organize findings by subject if possible (nested or labeled)

Photos, logs, and evidence modules inherit subject context if field ops are involved

---




### ‚õèÔ∏è Gold Miner Metaphor:

Section 1 is the claim site ‚Äî it tells you **where the gold is** and **what kind of tools** you‚Äôll need to extract and report it. It doesn‚Äôt mine the data, but it ensures you know how to handle whatever comes out of the ground.

It chooses:

* The **type of tray (report structure)**
* The **mesh size (granularity of detail)**
* The **processing method (billing, documentation)**

---

**Section 1 never changes. It defines everything else.**


---

**1. Report Type Logic Switch (Section 1)**

Section 1 operates as the primary control mechanism that determines the format and function of the report. It is a switch between distinct report modes based solely on the type of service sold and contractually defined. The selected report style controls how the rest of the report engine behaves.

### Report Types:

* **Investigative Report**

  * Contains only investigative findings, background data, asset info, or research results.
  * No surveillance or field operations.
  * Used for static intelligence reports.

* **Field Operations Report**

  * Contains only surveillance details, timelines, mileage, and photography.
  * No investigative analysis or documentation outside of field activities.

* **Hybrid Report**

  * Contains both investigative and field sections.
  * Structures a narrative timeline integrating all available intelligence.
  * Used when the case spans both research and surveillance.

### Logic Control:

* The switch is determined by reviewing all active contracts.
* If no field operation contract is found, default to **Investigative**.
* If only a surveillance or field contract is present, default to **Field**.
* If both are found, trigger **Hybrid** mode.

The rest of the report structure (sections, formatting, billing, photos) will adapt dynamically based on the report type selected here.

---

**2. Report Structure by Type**

Once the report type is selected, the structure and headings of the document are dynamically adjusted to fit the mode. This ensures accuracy in presentation and avoids displaying irrelevant modules.

### Investigative Report

**For cases like Roberts with no field operations**

**Headings:**

1. Case Overview
2. Client Objectives
3. Investigative Findings
4. Subject Background / Records
5. Document Review Summary
6. Conclusion & Recommendations
7. Contract Billing Summary

**Modules Disabled:**

* Field Activity Timeline
* Surveillance Media
* Mileage / Travel Logs
* Hourly Billing Sections

### Field Operations Report

**For cases involving only surveillance or field ops**

**Headings:**

1. Case Overview
2. Surveillance Objectives
3. Field Activity Timeline
4. Photographic Evidence
5. Surveillance Logs
6. Hourly and Mileage Billing
7. Contract Billing Summary

**Modules Disabled:**

* Research
* Investigative Analysis
* Background Checks

### Hybrid Report

**For cases involving both research and field ops**

**Headings:**

1. Case Overview
2. Client Objectives
3. Combined Investigative + Field Timeline
4. Research & Records Summary
5. Surveillance Log & Photos
6. Conclusions & Case Summary
7. Full Billing Summary

---

Only one report type is ever active per document. All structure, formatting, and billing behavior routes from this initial logic decision.

* Photo, asset, and field-based templates are disabled.
* Section navigation and export formats adapt to investigative-only structure.

**3. Pre-Investigative Summary Subsection Logic**

### Section 2 Label:

**PRE-INVESTIGATIVE SUMMARY**

This section is included in all investigative reports but its **subsections render conditionally** based on the nature of the investigation and client contract.

### Subsection Display Rules:

| Subsection                                   | Display When...                                                                                                     | Suppress When...                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A. Case Summary**                          | Always shown to introduce context and scope.                                                                        | *Never suppressed*                                                                                     |
| **B. Subject Profile**                       | Shown when subject identification or location is key to the case (e.g., skip trace, missing person).                | Suppressed for fraud, financial, or corporate cases where subject profile is not central.              |
| **C. Behavioral Patterns & Known Locations** | Displayed when routines, patterns, or movement history support the investigation.                                   | Suppressed for document-based or transactional investigations with no behavioral tracking.             |
| **D. Surveillance Zones & Planning Maps**    | Rendered when there is geographical relevance to investigation (e.g., place-based searching, process serving prep). | Suppressed when case is fully digital, static, or internal (e.g., fraud/theft with no field planning). |
| **E. Final Planning Statement**              | Always displayed. Provides legal, ethical, and procedural framing of the investigation.                             | *Subcontractor clauses are suppressed unless the case escalates to Hybrid Report mode.*                |

This logic ensures that each investigative report maintains structure and professionalism while removing irrelevant or empty sections dynamically.

**4. Investigation Report Logic (Section 3 Redefined)**

### Section Name:

**INVESTIGATION DETAILS**

This section replaces the daily log format with a **structured investigative narrative**. It is flexible, modular, and based on the actual tasks and services performed.

### Use Cases:

* Background checks
* Asset tracing
* Employment verification
* Identity development
* Public records retrieval
* Document examination
* Skip tracing logs
* Surveillance prep intelligence

### Functional Changes:

* Removes date-stamped surveillance rows
* Replaces bullet-style summaries with formal investigative findings
* Can be structured by phases (e.g., Phase 1: Research, Phase 2: Verification)
* Maintains format integrity with dynamic content mapping

---

**5. Supporting Evidence & Case Artifacts (Section 4)**

### Section Name:

**SUPPORTING EVIDENCE**

This section replaces surveillance-based meta-data logs and instead focuses on **what was discovered**, **how it was verified**, and **the source of each item**.

### Contents May Include:

* Interview summaries
* Call logs with timestamps
* Court or legal documents
* Police reports
* Screenshots of background results
* Public record screenshots
* File references and internal memos

### Format:

Each entry includes:

* **Evidence Type**
* **Source**
* **Date Acquired**
* **Verification Method**
* **Result or Outcome**

The section is used to demonstrate the investigative depth and reinforce case validity in absence of surveillance logs.

---

**6. Billing Summary Adjustments (Section 6)**

In Investigative Report mode, the billing summary will:

* ‚úÖ **Retain:**

  * Flat-rate contract billing blocks
  * Planning cost evaluation (including \$500 rule logic when applicable)
  * Administrative and report generation costs
  * Records retrieval charges
  * Final total calculation engine

* ‚ùå **Suppress:**

  * All Surveillance Operation cost breakdowns
  * Mileage logs
  * Hourly field time billings
  * Asset deployment entries

This ensures billing aligns strictly with investigative-only services without triggering irrelevant surveillance billing structures.

When Field Surveillance is the main contract:

Pre-Surveillance Planning remains active and unchanged

Billing logic follows default hourly/mileage structure

Daily Logs and Session Reviews operate under standard surveillance reporting

No suppression or alternate structures are applied

This default flow ensures consistency across standard surveillance deployments.


Hybrid Report Integration Logic

The Hybrid Report merges both investigative and surveillance operations in a cohesive timeline.

Section 2: Client Objectives

Retains the original investigative structure from the investigative report model.

Presents client needs, goals, and scope as originally outlined.

No structural changes are applied.

Section 3: Investigation Details

Presents investigative results gathered prior to field work.

Concludes with a declaration that based on case progression, in-field operations were required.

Follows with surveillance logs and findings with no format changes.

Section 4: Supporting Evidence

Mirrors the flow of Section 3.

Begins with evidence collected during investigative phase.

Transitions into surveillance evidence.

Maintains distinct source attribution to clarify origin.



ADVANCED BILLING & STRUCTURE LOGIC SCRIPT

1. Flat-Rate Contract Behavior (Initial Phase)

When a client signs a flat-rate contract (e.g., Missing Person Investigation), the billing engine locks into FLAT_RATE_SERVICE mode.

This contract covers all services listed in the agreement: reporting, planning, documentation, investigation.

No hourly billing, time tracking, or additional charges are allowed.

Section 6 of the report reflects a single flat rate service, follows the remaining final billing accounting logic.

2. Evolution into Field Operations (Optional Add-On)

If the case later requires field work, a new contract is issued (e.g., $2,500 for surveillance).

The new contract stacks onto the original but does not overwrite it.

The billing engine switches to HYBRID_MODE, separating:

Original flat-rate contract

Field operations contract (flat or hourly)

Section 6 of the report shows line-by-line breakdown of each contract, runs a cumulative total listing each contract and cost.

3. The $500 Rule (Planning Cost Reservation)

This rule applies only when a surveillance-only contract is issued, with no prior investigative contracts.

In such cases, the system reserves the first $500 of the surveillance contract as compensation for reporting, planning, and structuring the case.

This reservation is shown in the billing output but does not add to the contract total‚Äîit extracts from it.

This ensures the reporting workload is acknowledged in contracts that do not otherwise include structural labor.

All other contract types are assumed to include reporting and structure inherently, and therefore do not trigger this rule.

4. Multi-Contract Mode (Advanced Trigger)

If three or more contracts are present, or if contracts span multiple phases (investigative, document, field ops), the system triggers MULTICONTRACT_MODE.

This disables the $500 planning fee permanently for the case.

All billing is then calculated through contract stacking only.

5. Contract Chronology Enforcement

All contracts are sorted by signature date.

Billing logic processes contracts in chronological order.

Surveillance contracts may not precede flat-rate investigative agreements without triggering a logic conflict.

6. Runtime Triggers & Failsafes

Logic can trigger at any point in the case lifecycle.

If a new contract is added later in the case, the system reevaluates billing structure and may auto-disable planning logic.

Manual overrides are logged and flagged.

7. Section 6 Behavior

If flat-rate only: one line for the prepaid service.

If hybrid: each contract listed in order with its date and value.

If field ops added: time logs and photo logic activated, billed separately.

If MULTICONTRACT_MODE: no planning fee, billing reflects full case evolution.

8. Surveillance Billing After Multi-Contract Pre-Structure

If the case has multiple contracts already executed before surveillance begins (e.g., background checks, asset searches, document retrieval), the total cost of those contracts is compiled.

These contracts are treated as full payment for all pre-surveillance planning and structure.

When surveillance is sold later (e.g., $2,500), it is billed independently using standard hourly billing logic.

The $500 rule is disabled because planning has already been paid.

Section 6 itemizes all previous contracts first, followed by surveillance billing.

All hourly billing rules (time, mileage, media) apply to the surveillance contract without interruption.

The report clearly separates what was previously contracted from what was added later.

System Enforcements

No billing overwrites allowed

Structure logic tied to contracts, not templates

Chronology matters: all contracts processed by date

Case structure reflects what was actually sold, not assumptions
