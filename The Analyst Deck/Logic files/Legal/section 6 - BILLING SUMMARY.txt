**SECTION 6 – BILLING SUMMARY LOGIC (ENGLISH)**

---

**ROLE OF SECTION 6**

* Section 6 provides a comprehensive, itemized billing breakdown.
* It directly reflects the contract structure, report type, and sequence of services rendered.
* This section is legally binding and must reflect the investigative and field operations precisely.

---

**LOGIC SWITCHES**

**IF report\_type = Investigative:**

* Billing model: Flat rate
* Output:

  * Investigative Research Fee (flat rate)
  * Documentation Delivery Fee (if applicable)
  * Admin & Compliance Review (optional)
* Surveillance, mileage, and field ops are suppressed

**IF report\_type = Field:**

* Billing model: Hourly / Per-mile / Flat (as per contract)
* Output:

  * Field Surveillance Hours (per shift or date)
  * Mileage Total
  * Equipment / Data Fees (if applicable)
  * Report Generation Fee (per session)
* No investigative fees appear

**IF report\_type = Hybrid:**

* Billing model: Tiered / Stacked
* Output:

  * Investigative Services Fee (Flat or per-document)
  * Surveillance Operations (per hour/day)
  * Mileage and Travel
  * Combined Report Compilation Fee
  * Additional Document Recovery (if applicable)
* **Structure Adapts Based on Contract Order:**

  * If Surveillance was first:

    * Investigative tasks billed as deductions from Field funds (up to \$500 offset)
  * If Investigative was first:

    * Full rates apply to both investigative and surveillance services (no deduction)

---

**CONTRACT SEQUENCE EFFECTS**

* Contract timestamps determine billing grouping and offset eligibility
* If multiple contracts exist:

  * Most recent governs label display
  * All appear as separate lines unless otherwise merged by contract language
* Additional contracts always produce **supplemental billing**, not suppression

---

**REQUIRED LABELS & LEGAL STRUCTURE**

* Each billed line must include:

  * Service Type
  * Date/Time of Delivery
  * Description
  * Rate or Flat Fee
  * Billing Source (Contract Reference)
* North Star and Cochran compliance enforced:

  * No inferred billing
  * All items must tie to a report section or operational record

---

**NOTES AND DISCLOSURES**

* Insert planning offset note only if \$500 deduction is valid:

  > “Investigative services provided under this contract are offset against the first \$500 of field surveillance as agreed.”
* Add notation for any document-based investigative request billed separately
* Subcontractor tasks billed under subcontractor rate table, if applicable

---

**BILLING ENFORCEMENT**

* Logic is non-negotiable
* Tampering or override flags the report
* Final summary must reconcile with:

  * Section 1 declared structure
  * Section 2 investigative outputs
  * Section 3 field logs
  * Section 4 evidentiary validation
