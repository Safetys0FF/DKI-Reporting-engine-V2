# Section DP (Disclosure & Authenticity Page) - Structured Rebuild Roadmap (Draft)

> **Order Lock:** Section 1/Gateway must execute first. Section DP depends on Sections CP, 7, and 9 readiness and must respect that order.

## 1. Mission Statement
Present formal disclosure and authenticity statements that mirror cover page credentials, conclusion outcomes, and certification approvals before final assembly.

## 2. System Context
- **Ingress:** Gateway bundle with `cover_profile` (Section CP), `conclusion_manifest` (Section 7), `certification_manifest` (Section 9), compliance flags, disclosure templates, approval logs.
- **Egress:** `section_dp_payload` containing disclosure text, authenticity statements, signature records, QA flags, provenance.
- **Scope:** Reuse branding/credentials, ensure legal disclosures remain consistent, capture final authenticity acknowledgements.

## 3. Gateway Communication Contract
- `gateway.prepare_section('section_dp')` – triggered after Section CP, Section 7, and Section 9 publish.
- `gateway.get_section_inputs('section_dp')` – returns `{cover_profile, conclusion_manifest, certification_manifest, disclosure_templates, compliance_flags}`.
- `gateway.publish_section_result('section_dp', payload)` – posts disclosure output, QA flags, provenance, stage confirmations.
- `gateway.subscribe('cover_profile_revision', handler)` – rerun if cover data changes.
- `gateway.emit('disclosure_ready', manifest)` – notify final assembly when disclosure validated.

## 4. Stage Checklist & Checkpoints
| Stage | Description | Inputs | Checkpoint |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Intake | Pull inputs, verify cover/conclusion/certification hashes, load templates. | gateway bundle | `sdp_intake_logged` |
| Compile | Assemble disclosure/authenticity text, reuse signatures, incorporate conclusion status. | templates + manifests | `sdp_compiled` |
| Validate | Ensure disclosures align with certification/conclusion; log compliance flags. | compiled payload | `sdp_validated` or `sdp_requires_action` |
| Publish | Publish payload to gateway, emit disclosure signal. | validated payload | `section_dp_completed` |
| Monitor | Handle revisions (cover/conclusion/cert updates) while enforcing ``max_reruns`` and tracking ``revision_depth``. | signals | `sdp_revision_processed` |

## 5. Guardrails & Failsafes
- Execution blocked until Sections CP, 7, and 9 validated.
- Disclosure text must mirror certification/cover language; mismatches flagged.
- Legal text updates require manual approval logged in provenance.
- Dual sign-off required for authenticity statement publication.
- Manual edits recorded with operator ID/timestamp.
- Immutability: once disclosure is approved the payload is frozen; reopen requires authorization and archives prior versions.

## 6. Fallback Hierarchy
1. Pull text from cover and certification manifests; adapt conclusion summary for authenticity statement.
2. If missing, revert to templates with manual approval requirement.
3. Abort with `section_blocked` if legal text cannot be validated.

## 7. Sectional Staging & Call-Out Procedures
- Runs after CP, conclusion, and certification sections.
- Emits `disclosure_ready` to final assembly.
- Receives `request_disclosure_revision` from FR or compliance; reruns after updates.

## 8. Information Handlers
- **Disclosure manifest:** statement text, references to cover/conclusion/certification, signature records, QA flags.
- **Compliance log:** checks performed, outstanding issues.
- **Manual queue:** pending approvals or adjustments.

## 9. Narrative Blueprint
- Fixed templates for disclosure and authenticity statements (no free-form narrative).
- Placeholders only when manual approvals pending.

## 10. Dissemination & Intelligence Sharing
- Provide disclosure page to final assembly and UI.
- Update fact graph nodes so downstream systems see the final authenticity status.
- Receive feedback (e.g., updated legal text) and reconcile.
- Maintain version history for audit.
## 11. Documentation Alignment & Enforcement
- Reference docs:
  - README: `Sections/section_readme/Section_DP_README.md`
  - Engines/renderers: `Sections/section_engines/`, `section_renderers/section_dp_renderer.py`
  - Templates: share with CP and 9 to ensure consistency
  - SOP: `dev_tracking/templates/Section_DP_Rebuild_Playbook.md`, `CoreSystem/SOP.md`
- Enforcement: align template rules with documentation; include doc version hash; tests verifying disclosure schema vs documentation; update README/SOP on change.

## 12. Implementation To-Do (Section DP)
- [ ] Integrate gateway inputs with Section 1 order lock verification.
- [ ] Implement compilation pipeline connecting cover/conclusion/certification content with persistence write-through.
- [ ] Define `section_dp_payload` schema (disclosure manifest, approvals, QA flags, provenance).
- [ ] Update renderer to output disclosure/authenticity page with approval tracking.
- [ ] Add signals for `disclosure_ready`, revision handling, compliance approvals.
- [ ] Extend tests: consistency checks, manual queue, revision loop, ``max_reruns`` guardrails, template style lint.
- [ ] Refresh README/SOP with final architecture and note Section 1 order lock.
