# Section 9 (Certification & Disclaimers) - Structured Rebuild Roadmap (Draft)

> **Order Lock:** Section 1/Gateway first. Section 9 depends on Sections 1 and CP (and conclusion/billing for references) and must respect that order.

## 1. Mission Statement
Record investigator/agency certifications and required disclaimers consistent with cover branding and case scope before final assembly.

## 2. System Context
- **Ingress:** Gateway bundle with `case_metadata`, `cover_profile` (Section CP), `conclusion_manifest` (Section 7), `billing_summary` (Section 6), toolkit compliance flags, legal disclaimer templates.
- **Egress:** `section_9_payload` containing certification text, disclaimers, signature records, QA flags, provenance.
- **Scope:** Reuse cover credentials, integrate disclaimers, capture certification approvals, ensure legal consistency.

## 3. Gateway Communication Contract
- `gateway.prepare_section('section_9')` – triggered after Section CP and Section 7 (and optionally Section 6) ready.
- `gateway.get_section_inputs('section_9')` – returns `{cover_profile, conclusion_manifest, billing_summary, compliance_flags, disclaimer_templates}`.
- `gateway.publish_section_result('section_9', payload)` – posts certification payload, QA flags, provenance, stage confirmations.
- `gateway.subscribe('cover_profile_revision', handler)` – rerun if cover data changes.
- `gateway.emit('certification_ready', manifest)` – notify final assembly and UI when certification validated.

## 4. Stage Checklist & Checkpoints
| Stage | Description | Inputs | Checkpoint |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Intake | Pull inputs, confirm cover profile hash, load compliance flags. | gateway bundle | `s9_intake_logged` |
| Compile | Assemble certification text, disclaimers, signature assets, case references. | cover profile + templates | `s9_compiled` |
| Validate | Ensure compliance (license, case scope), confirm disclaimers match conclusion/billing. | compiled payload | `s9_validated` or `s9_requires_action` |
| Publish | Publish payload, emit certification signal. | validated payload | `section_9_completed` |
| Monitor | Handle revisions (cover or conclusion changes) while enforcing ``max_reruns`` and tracking ``revision_depth``. | signals | `s9_revision_processed` |

## 5. Guardrails & Failsafes
- Execution blocked until Section 1/CP validated.
- Certification text must mirror cover credentials; discrepancies block publication.
- Outdated disclaimers flagged; manual approval required for edits.
- Signature/approval records stored; dual sign-off for final certification.
- Manual edits logged with operator ID and justification.
- Immutability: once certification is approved the payload is frozen; reopen requires authorization and archives prior versions.

## 6. Fallback Hierarchy
1. Use cover profile and conclusion data.
2. Pull defaults from user profile if cover data missing (must be logged).
3. Manual entry via gateway queue for unresolved items.
4. Abort with `section_blocked` if legal text cannot be validated.

## 7. Sectional Staging & Call-Out Procedures
- Runs near end (after cover and conclusion).
- Emits `certification_ready` to final assembly.
- Receives `request_certification_revision` from FR or compliance; reruns after updates.

## 8. Information Handlers
- **Certification manifest:** investigator name/license, agency, date/time, signature records, disclaimers.
- **Compliance log:** checks performed, outstanding issues.
- **Manual queue:** pending approvals or updates.

## 9. Narrative Blueprint
- Fixed templates for certification/disclaimer text (no free-form narrative).
- Placeholders only when manual approval pending.

## 10. Dissemination & Intelligence Sharing
- Provide certification to final assembly and UI.
- Update fact graph nodes with final certification status for downstream visibility.
- Receive feedback (e.g., updated disclaimers) and reconcile.
- Maintain version history for audit.
## 11. Documentation Alignment & Enforcement
- Reference docs:
  - README: `Sections/section_readme/Section_9_README.md`
  - Engines/renderers: `Sections/section_engines/`, `section_renderers/section_9_renderer.py`
  - Toolkit logic: `MasterToolKitEngine` (compliance flags)
  - SOP: `dev_tracking/templates/Section_9_Rebuild_Playbook.md`, `CoreSystem/SOP.md`
- Enforcement: embed template rules; include doc version hash; tests verifying certification schema vs documentation; update README/SOP on change.

## 12. Implementation To-Do (Section 9)
- [ ] Integrate gateway inputs with Section 1 order lock verification.
- [ ] Implement compilation pipeline using cover profile and compliance templates with persistence write-through.
- [ ] Define `section_9_payload` schema (certification manifest, disclaimers, QA flags, approvals, provenance).
- [ ] Update renderer to output certification page with approval tracking.
- [ ] Add signals for `certification_ready`, revision handling, compliance approvals.
- [ ] Extend tests: certification matching, disclaimer updates, manual queue, revision loop, ``max_reruns`` guardrails, template style lint.
- [ ] Refresh README/SOP with final architecture and note Section 1 order lock.
