# Section 7 (Conclusion) - Structured Rebuild Roadmap (Draft)

> **Order Lock:** Section 1/Gateway first. Section 7 depends on Sections 1-6 (and 8 when media context needed) and must respect that order.

## 1. Mission Statement
Deliver a professional conclusion grounded in validated evidence, planning directives, and compliance checks, signaling investigative status.

## 2. System Context
- **Ingress:** Gateway bundle with `case_metadata`, `planning_manifest` (Section 2), `surveillance_narratives` (Section 4), `billing_summary` (Section 6), `document_inventory` (Section 5), `media_index` (Section 8), toolkit QA flags.
- **Egress:** `section_7_payload` containing conclusion narrative, status recommendation, evidence references, QA flags, provenance.
- **Scope:** Summarize findings, confirm continuity, flag outstanding issues, indicate next steps (closed vs more work).

## 3. Gateway Communication Contract
- `gateway.prepare_section('section_7')` – triggered after Sections 4 and 6 complete (and optionally Section 8).
- `gateway.get_section_inputs('section_7')` – returns `{case_metadata, planning_manifest, surveillance_review, billing_summary, document_inventory, media_index, toolkit_results}`.
- `gateway.publish_section_result('section_7', payload)` – posts conclusion output, QA flags, provenance, stage confirmations.
- `gateway.subscribe('session_review_revision', handler)` – rerun if Section 4 updates narratives.
- `gateway.emit('conclusion_ready', manifest)` – notify final assembly and UI when conclusion validated.

## 4. Stage Checklist & Checkpoints
| Stage | Description | Inputs | Checkpoint |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Intake | Pull inputs, confirm upstream hashes, load toolkit QA results. | gateway bundle | `s7_intake_logged` |
| Synthesize | Aggregate findings (surveillance, documents, billing), derive conclusion narrative. | upstream payloads | `s7_synthesized` |
| Validate | Ensure continuity, legal/compliance checks; confirm no contradictions. | conclusion draft, toolkit | `s7_validated` or `s7_requires_action` |
| Publish | Publish payload to gateway, emit conclusion signal. | validated payload | `section_7_completed` |
| Monitor | Handle revision requests from downstream (FR, UI) or upstream updates while enforcing ``max_reruns`` and tracking ``revision_depth``. | signals | `s7_revision_processed` |

## 5. Guardrails & Failsafes
- Execution blocked until Sections 1-6 (and 8 if required) validated.
- Conclusion must reference confirmed evidence; unresolved conflicts logged and block publication.
- Narrative template enforces objective tone; speculation flagged for manual approval.
- Manual edits recorded with operator ID/timestamp; approvals captured in payload provenance.
- Immutability: once the conclusion is approved the payload is locked; reopen requires authorization and archives prior versions.
- Risk flags (outstanding questions, legal concerns) explicitly documented.

## 6. Fallback Hierarchy
1. Use structured outputs from Sections 2-6.
2. Consult toolkit cache or change queue for unresolved items.
3. Manual narrative supplement via gateway queue.
4. Abort: `section_blocked` if critical inputs missing.

## 7. Sectional Staging & Call-Out Procedures
- Runs near end (after operational sections).
- Emits `conclusion_ready` to final assembly and UI.
- Receives `request_conclusion_revision` from FR or stakeholders; reruns once dependencies updated.

## 8. Information Handlers
- **Conclusion manifest:** status, summary bullets, evidence references, risk notes, QA status.
- **Fact graph integration:** Publish final status nodes so exports and downstream systems reference consistent entities and timelines.
- **Conflict log:** unresolved issues needing attention before final assembly.
- **Manual queue:** pending narrative approvals or conflict resolutions.

## 9. Narrative Blueprint
- Template: executive summary, key findings, evidence references, risk/next steps, closure status.
- Placeholders only when manual review pending; flagged for QA.
- Maintain `draft_conclusion` and `approved_conclusion` versions with change log.

## 10. Dissemination & Intelligence Sharing
- Provide conclusion to final assembly, UI, client handoff.
- Receive feedback (e.g., final assembly needs adjustment) via gateway; reconcile.
- Maintain version history for audit.

## 11. Documentation Alignment & Enforcement
- Reference docs:
  - README: `Sections/section_readme/Section_7_README.md`
  - Engines/renderers: `Sections/section_engines/`, `section_renderers/section_7_renderer.py`
  - Toolkit logic: `MasterToolKitEngine`
  - SOP: `dev_tracking/templates/Section_7_Rebuild_Playbook.md`, `CoreSystem/SOP.md`
- Enforcement: embed parsing rules in synthesis stage; include doc version hash; tests verifying conclusion schema vs documentation; update README/SOP on change.

## 12. Implementation To-Do (Section 7)
- [ ] Integrate gateway inputs with Section 1 order lock verification.
- [ ] Build synthesis pipeline aggregating outputs from Sections 2-6 (and 8) with validations and persistence write-through.
- [ ] Define `section_7_payload` schema (conclusion manifest, evidence references, QA flags, provenance).
- [ ] Update renderer to output structured conclusion with approval workflow.
- [ ] Add signals for `conclusion_ready`, revision handling, conflict resolution.
- [ ] Extend tests: continuity checks, risk flagging, manual queue, revision loop, ``max_reruns`` guardrails, narrative style lint.
- [ ] Refresh README/SOP with final architecture and note Section 1 order lock.
