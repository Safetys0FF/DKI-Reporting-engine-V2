No claims made by the client were independently tested, verified, or contested prior to field deployment. The following section outlines the objectives, scope, and preliminary findings conducted by DKI Services LLC before initiating field surveillance. This includes verification of subject information, locations of interest, behavioral patterns, and logistics planning to ensure legal and operational efficiency. All intelligence information was obtained before live observation and cross-referenced against client observations and suspicions disclosed during the intake process.
