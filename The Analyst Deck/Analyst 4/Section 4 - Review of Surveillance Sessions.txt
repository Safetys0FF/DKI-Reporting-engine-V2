**SECTION 4: REVIEW OF SURVEILLANCE SESSIONS - ENGLISH BASED LOGIC GUIDE**

---

**Purpose of Section 4**
Section 4 is the official, factual record of the surveillance operations. This section explains what was seen, who was seen, when, where, and why it matters. It is not a casual recap. It is the courtroom-ready account that connects physical observation to investigative goals.

---

**SECTION 1 – REPORT TYPE LOGIC SWITCHES (ENGLISH LOGIC)**

---

**LOGIC SWITCH BEHAVIOR ONLY**

Section 1 determines the `report_type` based on:

1. Contract Type (name or metadata)
2. Client Intake Goals
3. Field Work Clauses present or absent
4. Active contract count and type

---

**LOGIC CONDITIONS**

* **IF report\_type = Investigative:**

  * Change heading to "Investigation Findings"
  * Enable Investigative mode, notate in summary format results of the findings in section 3; Investigative Details
  * Billing model = Flat

* **IF report\_type = Field:**

  * Suppress all Investigative modules
  * Enable Field-only modules (logs, visuals, time)
  * Billing model = Hourly or Flat

* **IF report\_type = Hybrid:**

  * Enable both Investigative and Field modules
  * Requires phase mapping:

    * Phase 1 = Investigative
    * Phase 2 = Field
  * Billing model = Stacked or Tiered
  * Require trigger link from Investigative result to Field deployment

- Surveillance modules in Section 3 and 4 are only enabled once a verified investigative finding justifies in-field verification.

---

**FALLBACKS**

* If no contract type is matched, default to Field
* If 2+ contracts, most recent rules unless hybrid pattern confirmed

---

**LOGIC ENFORCEMENT**

* All downstream behavior strictly follows the `report_type` set by Section 1
* Section 1 logic cannot be overridden downstream
* Billing, section visibility, and formatting obey this switch



**Core Logic Rules:**

1. **Only Record What Matters:**
   If the event, person, or observation doesn't impact the investigation's objective, do not include it. This section is not a journal; it is an evidentiary narrative.

2. **Subject-Driven Narrative:**
   Everything written must tie back to the subject. We are not observing the world — we are observing the subject.

3. **Client-Linked Relevance:**
   If the client didn’t request it, reference it, or approve its use (in the case of apps or tools), it does not belong here.

4. **All Observations Must Be Supported:**
   If you mention an event, behavior, or quote — it must appear in the investigator’s log (Section 3). Section 4 pulls from Section 3, not the other way around.

5. **Metadata Only to Support — Never to Explain:**
   Metadata (e.g., timestamps, GPS pings) can be mentioned only if the investigator referenced them to explain a specific event. Never write about how the data was obtained.

6. **No Assumptions, No Theories:**
   Do not include hypothetical ideas or assumptions about why someone did something. Only state what happened and why it's relevant to the case.

7. **Chain of Observational Trust:**
   All tools, apps, and third-party data must follow the chain: Subject > Client > DKI > Field Operator. Never skip steps, and never imply that DKI obtained something on its own.

8. **Court-Ready Tone:**
   Every sentence must be written as if it will be read aloud in a courtroom. Use precise, objective language. Avoid casual, vague, or speculative terms.

---

**Structure Expectations:**

* Date of Surveillance
* Times and Locations of Surveillance
* Visual Confirmation of Subject(s)
* Observed Behavior (Relevant Only)
* Subject Interactions (Names, Vehicles, Conversations)
* Legal Observations (Photos, Identifiers, Ring, etc.)
* Any deviations from prior behavior
* End Time or Surveillance Transfer

---

**Example: Poor vs. Proper Entry**

**Poor:** "The investigator waited in the car and drove around a bit. It was raining."
**Proper:** "At 3:30 PM, the investigator arrived at the subject's known residence. No vehicles or persons were present."

**Poor:** "Subject's phone pinged their location."
**Proper:** "The subject's vehicle was observed at Taco Nice on West Broad Street, consistent with earlier visual confirmation."

Section 4 is the chapter that justifies the entire operation. Treat every word like it has weight — because in court, it will.
