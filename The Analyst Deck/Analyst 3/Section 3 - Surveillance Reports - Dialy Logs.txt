**DKI Surveillance Integrity and Billing Logic (Live Field Version)**

---

**SECTION 3 – SURVEILLANCE SUMMARY: LOGIC SCRIPT (ENGLISH)**

---

**SECTION ROLE**

* Section 3 logs all field surveillance activity or investigative findings, depending on report type.
* It is suppressed, relabeled, or activated based on the contract type and field deployment flags.
* This section reflects only verified events captured by licensed investigators or subcontractors.

---

**LOGIC SWITCHES**

**IF report\_type = Investigative:**

* Section 3 relabels as: “INVESTIGATION DETAILS”
* Suppress all field surveillance elements
* Populate with:

  * Timeline of investigative findings
  * Key confirmations (employment, location, behavior)
  * Notes from document retrieval or interviews (where applicable)
* Suppress billing blocks tied to field time, drive time, or visual evidence

**IF report\_type = Field:**

* Section 3 label remains: “SURVEILLANCE SUMMARY”
* Populate daily logs by date and time
* Enable full billing breakdown:

  * Drive-To
  * Field Operation Time
  * Surveillance Engagement
  * Mobile Drive
  * Drive-From
* Activate metadata checks on:

  * Visual evidence timestamps
  * Narrative continuity
  * Subcontractor field ID verification
* All narrative content must trace to evidence or field log

**IF report\_type = Hybrid:**

* Section 3 relabels as: “INVESTIGATION DETAILS”
* Populate with:

  * Consolidated list of investigative findings
  * Confirmed elements from background, legal, or surveillance review
* Add Special Notation:

  > “Due to the needs of both the client and the case filed, investigation was requested.”
* Then, append surveillance logs as done in field reports:

  * Label block as: “FIELD DEPLOYMENT (PHASE 2)”
  * Populate with full surveillance logs (same format as Field)
  * Tag visuals as “Supplemental Verification” if used to confirm findings
* Billing logic:

  * Investigative tasks billed in Sections 1 & 2
  * Field time billed under Section 3

---

**STRUCTURE AND CONTENT FORMAT**

* Each entry begins with:

  * Date
  * Investigator name
  * Surveillance or Investigation type
  * Objective
  * Location (if applicable)
* Followed by timestamped narrative entries:

  * Time of observation or discovery
  * Subject behavior, action, or investigative finding
  * Transition events or travel (Field only)
* End-of-day or session summary concludes each block

---

**ENFORCEMENT RULES**

* No unsupported entries permitted (must link to visual or field data if field-based, or traceable evidence if investigative)
* Passive or speculative language is prohibited
* All subcontractor participation must be logged and declared
* Billing blocks are non-editable if locked by contract
* All field times must override timestamps received from client unless manually reversed

---

**SPECIAL CONDITIONS**

* If subcontractor report is included, label as “EXTERNAL FIELD ATTACHMENT”
* If subject is not observed (Field): “No visual contact was made during the logged window.”
* If subject activity exceeds contract time block: “Subject remained active past authorized tracking window.”

---

**COMPLIANCE CONTROLS**

* Section 3 narrative follows Section 2 formatting unless overridden
* All logs must clear metadata enforcement before release
* Reverse continuity checks active by default



**1. Operational Flow and Reporting Structure**

* All surveillance logs begin with metadata extraction from photos (EXIF, filename timestamp, overlay timestamp)
* First verifiable photo in the surveillance area marks the start of **field operations**
* First visual confirmation of the subject marks the beginning of **surveillance contact**
* Field time, drive time, and contact time are treated as distinct billing categories
* Metadata-anchored evidence supports all report entries and billing items

---

**2. Billing Categories and Required Anchors**

| Category                  | Evidence Required                                          | Billing Basis           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Drive-To (Deployment)     | First timestamped arrival photo, distance from base        | Time + mileage          |
| Field Operation           | Photo/log showing arrival and area sweep conclusion        | Total active hours      |
| Surveillance Engagement   | Timestamped photo or observation log confirming subject    | Time under direct watch |
| Mobile Surveillance Drive | Location photos, known venue routes, pursuit documentation | Mileage + time          |
| Drive-From (Return)       | Final field activity + timestamp, route to home base       | Time + mileage          |

---

**3. Validation and Data Consistency**

* Use the client intake, pre-surveillance reports, and routine profiles to define known subject activity
* Cross-reference photos with venue intelligence and timestamps
* Validate image content with known locations using public records and maps
* Compare observed subject behavior with expected behavior to detect routine breaks
* Identify inconsistencies between field logs, metadata, and narrative for clarification
* Unverified or unsupported entries must be **flagged for 1:1 Q\&A** — never deleted

---

**4. Reporting and Testimony Accountability**

* Each report entry must include:

  * Timestamp or filename-derived time of action
  * File references (image or log ID)
  * Investigator observations, not assumptions
  * Logic path to conclusion

* **Data handling in reporting:**

  * Use metadata to structure event timelines
  * Use known locations to justify travel/mileage
  * Align subject activity with location-based evidence
  * Ensure all narrative content is rooted in verifiable data

* **Reverse Logic Validation** (Mandatory)

  * Confirm narrative timestamps match metadata
  * Cross-check story against pre-surveillance intel
  * Validate that names, places, and event descriptions match known facts
  * Visual evidence **always overrides** written narrative when conflicting
  * If conflict arises (e.g., misidentified plate, wrong subject description):

    * **Trigger 1:1 Q\&A** with investigator
    * Confirm metadata, image content, and intended report context
    * Log and annotate the resolution prior to finalizing

* **No Section Advances Without Reverse Check**

  * Each section of the report is frozen until all narrative-evidence discrepancies are resolved and approved

---

2. Internal Evidence Control (Not for Report Inclusion)

Evidence Listing (Internal Only):

Total count of timestamped photos for that date

Reference to any matching pre-surveillance or intake report

Confirmation of visual validation for subject movements

No references to toolchain, software, or internal methodologies

Billing Anchor Fields (Internal Only):

Drive-to origin and destination (city-to-city)

Total field time recorded (first image to last image)

Active surveillance hours listed in 24hr format

Drive-from time recorded internally

Total mileage must be estimated from logs, GPS traces, or confirmed odometer entries

---

Continuity and Accuracy Enforcement

Continuity Check Requirements:

Every photo must align with its narrative placement.

Events cannot skip time without visual or field-logged justification.

Each subject movement must be traceable to:

Timestamped photo

Confirmed vehicle placement

Investigator log

Locations or claims not supported visually must be flagged and notated internally.

Reverse Validation Logic:

The narrative is double-checked against the photos.

Any visual evidence that contradicts the written statement overrides the field entry.

If the plate number or time doesn’t match, the error is flagged.

Q&A Trigger Points: Any of the following triggers a mandatory internal Q&A review:

Vague or unspecified times (“around noon”)

Unsupported transitions (e.g., “went to girlfriend’s house” without a photo or log)

Inconsistent license plate descriptions (e.g., written “678 BCD” but photo shows “BCD 678”)

Description of a subject that does not match the image

Missing locations

Surveillance claim without anchor

Resolution:

Every Q&A-triggered issue must be resolved through direct clarification from field logs, visual evidence, or the lead investigator’s review.

If no resolution is possible, the issue is either removed or labeled as an unresolved conflict and escalated.

---

4. Tone, Delivery, and Presentation Style

Use plain, factual, professional English.

Avoid passive voice, opinions, and qualifiers.

Present tense is preferred; past tense acceptable for closed actions.

No “storytelling.” This is a factual log, not a novel.

Limit each day’s entry to factual field performance only. Section 4 will house narrative summaries.

---

5. Integrity Controls and Investigator Authority

The lead investigator holds final review rights.

Subcontractor data is reviewed and validated before use.

No entry is destroyed — all anomalies are resolved, not deleted.

Each detail must withstand a legal or billing audit.

Any attempt to obscure, skip, or reframe timeline for simplicity is disallowed.

Surveillance is an integrity-based discipline. The evidence speaks — our job is to document it.

---

**5. Structure and Reporting Format**

Event Entry Header:

Format: Event Entry: [Day], [Month] [Date], [Year]

Date format is mandatory and must be consistent across all entries.

Investigator Line:

Full legal name of the investigator must be listed.

Attribution must be confirmed via:

Metadata (origin of photo, file creation info)

Field log entries (including arrival or contact times)

Subcontractor field reports or signed logs

If the investigator is not the primary, attribution must be traceable.

Start Time:

Based on the first visual evidence timestamp showing the investigator on location (e.g., first photo from Lawton after leaving Tulsa).

Reported in 24-hour military time.

Surveillance Type Classification:

Fixed Surveillance: Investigator is stationary (e.g., parked outside a residence).

Mobile Surveillance: Investigator is actively following or attempting to follow the subject.

Area Sweep: Investigator canvasses locations to locate the subject.

Static Surveillance: Unmoving observation at a known hotspot.

Mixed: Combines any of the above.

Narrative Logic:

Must begin with physical arrival and operational start (not just first subject contact).

Each movement must be time-anchored and matched to:

A photo with a timestamp

A known visual sequence

A location-specific field report

Transitions must be explained (e.g., “surveillance was lost in traffic, investigator proceeded to next known location”).

Business names or known addresses must be fully stated (e.g., “Dallas Renal Group, 3201 W Gore Blvd, Lawton, OK 73505”).

Never state investigative logic, tools, or strategy.

Do NOT mention how locations or hours were discovered (e.g., public maps or open-source research).

Do NOT include pattern recognition — we report facts only, not behavior interpretations.

---



**5. Q\&A Loop and Case Control**

* When data gaps or contradictions are present, the system pauses for direct investigator clarification
* No assumption or estimation is used without investigator confirmation
* **All actions, logs, and entries must be accounted for**
* Investigator (You) hold **final authority** on all report decisions and record validity

---

**6. Integrity Mandate**

> Every billable action must be supported by timestamped, verifiable evidence whenever possible. Unsupported, ambiguous, or unclear entries are **flagged for resolution**, not discarded. Final reporting must meet standards of legal testimony, client trust, and internal accountability — with the lead investigator retaining full authority over report certification.
