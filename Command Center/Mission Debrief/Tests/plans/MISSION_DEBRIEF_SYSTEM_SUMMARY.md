# Mission Debrief System Summary

## Overview
Mission Debrief assembles narrative deliverables, applies professional tooling, and coordinates downstream publishing. Following the latest integration work, it consumes live section enrichment signals, manages per-section updates, and surfaces state back onto the bus for Warden and the UI.

## Core Responsibilities
- Subscribe to `section.data.updated` and `gateway.section.complete` so narratives stay synchronized with Gateway enrichments.
- Queue and assemble section narratives through the Librarian (NarrativeAssembler) component with ECC validation.
- Manage professional tooling (templates, signatures, watermarks, printing) via dedicated adapters, all gated by ECC.
- Emit `mission_debrief.section.update`, `mission_debrief.section.complete`, and rich status payloads for dashboards and auditing.

## Architectural Highlights
- **Bus Registration:** `_register_with_bus()` now includes section lifecycle signals in addition to existing tooling operations.
- **Section Ledger:** `section_updates` and `section_completion_log` track enrichment metadata, completion timestamps, and bus context.
- **Snapshot API:** `get_bootstrap_status()` exposes update counts, completion totals, and tool availability for monitoring and tests.
- **Toolchain Orchestration:** Adapters remain ECC-aware while benefiting from the shared manifest and case snapshot APIs.

## Recent Enhancements
- NarrativeAssembler now caches bus updates, requeues enrichment payloads, and stores gateway completion events.
- Mission Debrief Manager mirrors those updates, re-emits standardized signals, and includes counts in its bootstrap status.
- Bus helpers route evidence manifest previews, latest status, and case snapshots to the UI through the central plugin.
- ECC alignment tightened: all operations confirm section authorization before processing tooling requests or narratives.

## Operational Status
- **Completed:** Bus subscription expansion, section update ledger, mission status surfacing, adapter alignment.
- **In Progress:** Automated reconciliation between manifest snapshots and narrative queue states.
- **Next:** Assisted narrative suggestions, deeper analytics for Analyst Deck, automated deposition packaging.
