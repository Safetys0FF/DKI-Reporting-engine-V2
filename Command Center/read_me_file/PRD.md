# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - DKI Command Ecosystem

## Document Summary
- Author: Product Strategy, Central Command
- Version: 1.0
- Last Updated: 2025-09-25
- Status: Draft for implementation alignment

## 1. Vision
Deliver a unified, courtroom-ready investigation reporting engine that automates evidence intake, analysis, narrative construction, and archival while giving operators real-time oversight and auditability.

## 2. Problem Statement
Investigative teams need a single platform that ingests heterogeneous evidence, enforces chain of custody, coordinates analyst workflows, and produces professional reports without manual collation or compliance risk. Existing tooling is fragmented, slow, and error prone.

## 3. Goals and Success Metrics
- **G1: Evidence Fidelity** - 100 percent of ingested evidence retains hash parity through final archival.
- **G2: Cycle Time** - Reduce mission lifecycle from intake to delivery to under four business hours for standard cases.
- **G3: Analyst Efficiency** - Analysts complete section reviews 40 percent faster via standardized frameworks and toolkits.
- **G4: Compliance Readiness** - Achieve full audit trace with immutable logs for all case actions.
- **G5: Extensibility** - New plugins deploy without downtime and are discoverable on first bus boot.

Metrics will be tracked via Ops Center dashboards (cycle time) and automated hash audits (fidelity).

## 4. Non-Goals
- Mobile-native UI delivery (deferred to future roadmap).
- Cloud multi-tenant deployment (current release targets on-prem automation).
- Automated evidence collection from field devices (external ingestion assumed).
- Machine learning classification beyond heuristic toolkits (planned in future phases).

## 5. Target Personas
- **Mission Operator** - Runs daily missions, coordinates intake, and monitors signals.
- **Lead Analyst** - Owns section quality, requests revisions, and signs off on content.
- **On-Call Engineer** - Maintains infrastructure, resolves incidents, evolves integrations.
- **Program Manager** - Monitors throughput, compliance metrics, and release readiness.

## 6. Key Use Cases
1. Operator ingests evidence batch, system classifies files, sections auto-populate tasks.
2. Analyst reviews section output, triggers revision (10-9), receives toolkit guidance, resubmits.
3. Mission Debrief assembles final narrative, applies digital signature, publishes to library.
4. Plugin developer deploys new OSINT enrichment plugin, bus discovers and registers it without restart of other modules.
5. Ops Center automation runs nightly regression tests and outputs compliance dashboard.

## 7. Functional Requirements
- **FR1 - Evidence Intake**: Support bulk file ingestion with metadata, classification, and routing to sections.
- **FR2 - Section Processing**: Provide templated frameworks for sections 1-9 plus CP, DP, TOC with stage checkpoints.
- **FR3 - Signal Orchestration**: Maintain publish/subscribe bus with standardized signals and fail-safe handling.
- **FR4 - Plugin Ecosystem**: Discover, validate, and manage third-party plugins with license enforcement.
- **FR5 - Mission Debrief**: Generate final reports, apply professional tooling, manage archives.
- **FR6 - UI Tooling**: Provide War Room interfaces for operators and analysts with drag-and-drop evidence support.
- **FR7 - Audit and Logging**: Log all mission actions with timestamp, operator ID, and signature of payloads.
- **FR8 - Automation**: Offer Ops Center scripts for regression, backups, and stress scenarios.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1 - Reliability**: 99.5 percent uptime for critical services during mission hours.
- **NFR2 - Performance**: Evidence classification completes within two minutes per 500MB batch under standard load.
- **NFR3 - Security**: Enforce ECC permission checks, encrypt API keys at rest, provide role-based access controls.
- **NFR4 - Scalability**: Support parallel section processing and plugin execution without blocking signals.
- **NFR5 - Maintainability**: Codebase must include tests for each section framework and tool adapter.
- **NFR6 - Compliance**: Maintain immutable audit logs and hash validations for all exported deliverables.

## 9. Release Phases
- **MVP (R1)**
  - Core bus runtime, Warden ECC, Marshall gateway, Evidence Locker basics, Analyst Deck frameworks 1-9, Mission Debrief narrative pipeline.
  - Manual UI launch with War Room processors.
- **Beta (R2)**
  - Plugin lifecycle tooling, professional report enhancements (signatures, watermarks), OSINT connectors, Ops Center monitoring dashboards.
- **GA (R3)**
  - Optional AI-assisted evidence tagging, cloud archive adapters, real-time mission monitoring, predictive scaling hooks.

## 10. Dependencies and Assumptions
- Python 3.11+ runtime with access to Tesseract, FFmpeg, and other external binaries listed in `The War Room/Processors/requirements.txt`.
- Operators follow SOP checklists; missteps invalidate mission output guarantees.
- Infrastructure provides sufficient disk throughput for media processing (NVMe recommended).
- Legal and compliance teams validate templates and archive retention requirements.

## 11. Risks and Mitigations
- **R1 - Complex Dependencies**: Heavy optional libraries may fail to install on constrained systems. *Mitigation*: Provide segmented install profiles and pre-flight checks in Ops Center.
- **R2 - Signal Saturation**: High-volume missions may overload the bus. *Mitigation*: Implement batching and backpressure (tracked in Data Bus backlog).
- **R3 - Plugin Malfunction**: Third-party plugins could destabilize runtime. *Mitigation*: Enforce sandboxing, require contract validation, maintain staging environment.
- **R4 - Analyst Adoption**: Templates may not match analyst workflows. *Mitigation*: Provide configurable stages and training materials.
- **R5 - Audit Failure**: Missing logs compromise compliance. *Mitigation*: Nightly verification scripts in Ops Center and enforced log rotation.

## 12. Open Questions
- Should mission archives replicate to external cloud storage in R2 or remain on-prem until GA?
- What service-level agreement is required for disaster recovery (cold standby vs hot failover)?
- Will AI-assisted classification be sourced internally or rely on third-party APIs with cost implications?
- Do client requirements mandate multilingual report generation in the near term?
