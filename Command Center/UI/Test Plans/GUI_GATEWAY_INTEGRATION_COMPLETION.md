# GUI Gateway Integration Work Summary

## Overview
Between 2025-09-30 13:00?15:00 local, the Enhanced GUI was rewired to talk directly with the Central Command Gateway Controller. The `central_plugin` adapter now bootstraps Warden/Gateway, registers GUI-facing signals on the shared `DKIReportBus`, and exposes helper methods the GUI can call without going through legacy Report Engine stubs.

## Key Code Changes
- **Gateway-aware adapter** ? `Command Center/UI/central_plugin.py` now:
  - Builds path list dynamically and lazy-loads Librarian & Debrief classes via `importlib`.
  - Initializes API manager once, tracks optional Smart Lookup/OSINT engines, and keeps a single bus instance.
  - Registers `gateway.handoff`, `gateway.signal.dispatch`, `gateway.status.request` handlers and exposes helpers (`route_evidence_handoff`, `dispatch_gateway_signal`, `get_gateway_status`, `process_evidence_comprehensive`, `process_report`, `get_api_status`, `ping_bus`).
  - Provides safe `log_event` fallback when the bus is unavailable.
- **GUI workflow updates** ? `Command Center/UI/enhanced_functional_gui.py` now calls the new helpers:
  - API diagnostics panels call `central_plugin.get_api_status()`.
  - Evidence processing invokes `central_plugin.process_evidence_comprehensive()` with the section hint & case metadata so the Gateway receives a structured handoff.
  - Narrative generation and report actions call `generate_narrative()` and `process_report()` respectively instead of the raw `send_to_bus` shim.
  - The bus connectivity test button now calls `central_plugin.ping_bus()`.
- **Regression harness** ? Added `Command Center/UI/test_gateway_wiring.py` to assert `gateway.*` signals stay registered and to exercise the new helper APIs.

## Routing & Dependencies
- **Local Processor Bootstrap**: Launcher/app adapter now appends `The War Room/Processors` (Poppler bin, ffmpeg) to `PATH` and sets `POPPLER_PATH` / `TESSDATA_PREFIX`, so bundled OCR tooling is discovered automatically once Tesseract is installed.
- Evidence intake path: GUI ? `central_plugin.process_evidence_comprehensive()` ? Evidence Locker `process_evidence_comprehensive()` ? `_handoff_to_gateway()` with the GUI-supplied metadata ? Gateway Controller queues & processes handoff (now logged as originating from `evidence_locker_main`).
- Narrative & report flows: GUI payloads invoke `NarrativeAssembler.assemble()` and `MissionDebriefManager.process_complete_report()` through adapter helpers, preserving ECC/Gateway references.
- Diagnostics: `get_api_status()` consolidates bus, API manager, Smart Lookup, and OSINT availability; `ping_bus()` exposes registered signals for GUI health panels.
- Optional dependencies (Smart Lookup, OSINT) are tolerated even when unavailable; helper methods fall back to structured `error` responses.

## Impact Assessment
- GUI operations now reach live Gateway logic, so evidence classification, section coordination, and report workflows can operate without the legacy Report Engine path.
- New helper layer centralizes cross-module communication, reducing the chance of stale `sys.path` hacks and simplifying future upgrades.
- Added diagnostics and regression tests give early warning if gateway binding regresses.

## Follow-up / Open Items
1. Refresh public docs (`SYSTEM_README.md`, `ENHANCED_GUI_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`, diagrams) to describe the new gateway routing and accurate build targets.
2. Revisit `central_plugin` helper coverage for Smart Lookup/OSINT once those modules are finalized.
3. Expand automated checks so GUI evidence actions assert specific Gateway outcomes (e.g., section queue updates) once the pipeline contracts are confirmed.
