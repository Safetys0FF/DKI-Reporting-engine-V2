# The Warden System Summary

## Overview
The Warden bootstraps Central Command by wiring the Ecosystem Controller (ECC), Gateway, Evidence Locker, and Mission Debrief into a cohesive control plane. It now shares the `DKIReportBus` with its child systems, listens for section activity, and broadcasts consolidated `mission.status` snapshots for dashboards and automation.

## Core Responsibilities
- Instantiate ECC and Gateway with a shared bus reference so both can subscribe to evidence and section events out of the box.
- Track module health, handoffs, and case lifecycle events; expose this telemetry through Warden status APIs.
- Mediate registration for Evidence Locker, Mission Debrief, and section toolkits to ensure ECC-aware execution.
- Emit mission-wide status updates when sections advance, enrichment arrives, or dependencies shift.

## Architectural Highlights
- **ECC Bus Hooks:** EcosystemController now accepts a bus, registers handlers for `section.data.updated` and `gateway.section.complete`, and emits `mission.status` updates.
- **Activity Log:** Section activity and completion events are persisted for historical audits and UI display.
- **Warden Status:** `get_warden_status()` aggregates ECC boot node details, gateway status, module health, and new mission telemetry.
- **Bootstrap Flow:** Warden injects the bus into ECC before instantiating the Gateway, guaranteeing consistent signal wiring across the stack.

## Recent Enhancements
- Added `_attach_bus` helper and bus handlers so ECC can react to enriched data and section completion events, updating section states automatically.
- Warden now feeds the shared bus into ECC during startup, enabling mission-wide signals without additional configuration.
- Mission status payloads include case snapshots, section states, and completion lists for UI and testing harnesses.
- Section activity logs are capped and surfaced through status APIs for quick diagnostics.

## Operational Status
- **Completed:** Shared bus bootstrap, mission status emission, section activity tracking, gateway/ECC synchronization.
- **In Progress:** Automated remediation workflows based on mission status alerts.
- **Next:** Multi-case orchestration tooling, external monitoring hooks, predictive task scheduling.
