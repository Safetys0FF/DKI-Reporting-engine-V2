# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Central Command

## 1. Purpose
Deliver a modular, resilient reporting and evidence management platform with strict chain-of-custody compliance.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **Warden (ECC):** Drift guard enforcement, state validation, ecosystem control.  
- **Marshall:** Evidence ingestion, gateway routing, audit logging.  
- **Evidence Locker:** Classifier, manifest, index, archival pipeline.  
- **Analyst Deck:** Section renderers, scaffolding, revision templates.  
- **War Room:** Central repository for engines, processors, and agent environments.  
- **Command Center:** Orchestration, UI dashboards, plugin layer.  
- **Ops Center:** Automation workflows, shared libraries, diagnostics harness.  

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Modular design with directory isolation per subsystem.  
- Automatic processor synchronization into War Room.  
- Full test coverage at subsystem and system-wide levels.  
- Audit trail integrity across all evidence operations.  

## 4. Success Criteria
- End-to-end workflow executed with zero ECC validation failures.  
- Evidence ingest-to-archive cycle validated across ≥100MB datasets.  
- Agent provisioning script generates compliant environment folders automatically.  
- Stress tests sustain 10+ concurrent investigations without degradation.
