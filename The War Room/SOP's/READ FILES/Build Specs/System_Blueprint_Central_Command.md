# System Blueprint – Central Command

## 1. System Overview
Central Command is a modular, fault-tolerant architecture designed to manage investigative reporting, evidence intake, and operational intelligence. The system is organized into **six core operational pillars** supported by an **Ops Center** for orchestration, automation, and diagnostics.

---

## 2. Core Pillars

### **2.1 Command Center**
- **Role:** Primary orchestration and user-facing subsystem.  
- **Components:**  
  - Data Bus (message routing between modules)  
  - Mission Debrief (report assembly and review)  
  - Plug-ins (auxiliary services: case management, digital signatures, watermarking)  
  - Start Menu (intake, runtime bootstrap, launch/installer)  
  - UI (panels, dashboards, control wizards)  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Initiate and monitor system lifecycle.  
  - Provide operators with control panels and status dashboards.  
  - Serve as interface layer between human operators and backend subsystems.  

---

### **2.2 The Warden**
- **Role:** Enforcement of ecosystem policy and drift guard validation.  
- **Components:**  
  - `ecosystem_controller.py`  
  - `gateway_controller.py`  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Execute ECC (Ecosystem Control & Continuity) loops.  
  - Validate state consistency before and after evidence operations.  
  - Block or quarantine modules failing validation.  

---

### **2.3 The Marshall**
- **Role:** Gateway and traffic control authority.  
- **Components:**  
  - Gateway services folder  
  - Evidence Manager module  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Secure inbound/outbound data flow.  
  - Route all evidence traffic into the Locker.  
  - Enforce input sanitation and authentication policies.  
  - Maintain audit logs for all external connections.  

---

### **2.4 Evidence Locker**
- **Role:** Evidence storage and archival subsystem.  
- **Components:**  
  - Manifest builder, classifier, class builder, indexer  
  - Locker main controller  
  - Static data flow modules  
  - Archives (immutable case bundles)  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Maintain chain of custody for all evidence.  
  - Generate sealed manifests and indexes for case packages.  
  - Handle long-term archival with integrity checks.  
  - Provide retrieval services for downstream reporting.  

---

### **2.5 The Analyst Deck**
- **Role:** Analytical and report construction subsystem.  
- **Components:**  
  - Logic files and scaffolding templates  
  - Section renderers (engines, readme, revisions)  
  - Test plan library  
  - Tool kits for modular assembly  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Convert validated evidence into structured investigative reports.  
  - Provide section-by-section rendering pipelines.  
  - Manage revisions and scaffolding for iterative drafting.  

---

### **2.6 The War Room**
- **Role:** Isolated processor and agent environment vault.  
- **Components:**  
  - `/Processors` (OCR, audio, video, driver engines)  
  - `/dev_tracking` (agent configurations and task directives)  
  - `/dki_env` (dedicated Python venv)  
  - `/SOP’s` (governance and procedural documentation)  
  - `/data` (raw test and development datasets)  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Centralize tool and engine deployments away from system runtime.  
  - Provide reproducible environments for agents.  
  - Store SOPs and policy frameworks for compliance.  

---

### **2.7 Ops Center**
- **Role:** Automation, diagnostics, and resilience testing.  
- **Components:**  
  - `/Automation` (scripts, Makefile hooks, job runners)  
  - `/Library` (shared utilities, cross-cutting functions)  
  - `/Stress Tests` (load simulation, diagnostic harnesses)  
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Orchestrate system-wide automation and testing.  
  - Run warroom-sync, agent provisioning, and archival scripts.  
  - Perform stress and fault-injection scenarios across pillars.  

---

## 3. Data Flow
1. **Ingress:** Data/evidence enters via The Marshall (Gateway).  
2. **Validation:** The Warden executes ECC validation and drift guard loops.  
3. **Processing:** Engines and processors in The War Room transform raw inputs.  
4. **Analysis:** The Analyst Deck assembles processed data into structured reports.  
5. **Custody:** Evidence is secured in the Evidence Locker, archived with manifest.  
6. **Output:** Command Center generates UI dashboards, narrative reports, and exports.  

---

## 4. Security & Compliance
- ECC Validation: Mandatory three-cycle validation loop (state integrity, continuity, drift).  
- Chain of Custody: Evidence Locker enforces immutability and audit logging.  
- Isolation: War Room engines never reside in production runtime to prevent dependency scatter.  
- Testing: Ops Center Stress Tests simulate load and attack surfaces.  

---

## 5. Scalability & Resilience
- **Modular Deployment:** Each pillar is directory-isolated, enabling independent upgrade/replacement.  
- **Diagnostics Harness:** Ops Center provides global and subsystem test suites.  
- **Failover Recovery:** `make clean` resets runtime; sealed archives provide rollback guarantees.
