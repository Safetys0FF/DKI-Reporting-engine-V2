# The Warden System Summary

## Overview
The Warden bootstraps Central Command by wiring the Ecosystem Controller (ECC), Gateway, Evidence Locker, Mission Debrief, and SectionBusAdapter into a cohesive control plane. It shares the `DKIReportBus` across all child systems, monitors section activity, and broadcasts consolidated `mission.status` snapshots for dashboards and automation.

## Core Responsibilities
- Instantiate ECC, Gateway, Locker, Librarian, and GUI adapters with a shared bus reference so they can publish/subscribe to evidence and section events out of the box.
- Track module health, classification handoffs, SectionBusAdapter analytics, and case lifecycle events; expose this telemetry through Warden status APIs.
- Mediate registration for locker manifests, mission narratives, billing analytics, and disclosure catalogs to maintain ECC-aware execution.
- Emit mission-wide status updates when sections advance, enrichment arrives, or billing/analytics summaries change.

## Architectural Highlights
- **ECC Bus Hooks:** EcosystemController consumes `section.data.updated`, `evidence.updated`, and Gateway completion events, emitting `mission.status` with manifest summaries, billing totals, and disclosure readiness.
- **Activity Log:** Section activity, evidence handoffs, and SectionBusAdapter outputs are persisted for diagnostics and Analyst Deck QA replay.
- **Warden Status:** `get_warden_status()` aggregates ECC boot data, gateway catalog metrics, locker dedupe stats, SectionBusAdapter analytics, and mission telemetry for the Enhanced GUI.
- **Bootstrap Flow:** Warden injects the bus into ECC before instantiating Gateway and SectionBusAdapter, ensuring consistent signal wiring across the stack.

## Recent Enhancements
- Coordinated boot sequence so SectionBusAdapter registers handlers immediately after bus initialization, guaranteeing sections request evidence on startup.
- Expanded mission status payloads to include locker dedupe metrics, billing summaries, disclosure catalog state, and Librarian narrative progress.
- Hardened activity logs with evidence classification metadata and enrichment timestamps to support Analyst Deck regression checks.
- Surfaced SectionBusAdapter analytics and disclosure readiness in Warden status APIs, enabling GUI dashboards to highlight report completeness.

## Operational Status
- **Completed:** Shared bus bootstrap, mission status emission, section activity tracking, SectionBusAdapter integration, gateway/ECC synchronization.
- **In Progress:** Automated remediation workflows based on mission status alerts and analytics thresholds.
- **Next:** Multi-case orchestration tooling, external monitoring hooks, predictive task scheduling.
