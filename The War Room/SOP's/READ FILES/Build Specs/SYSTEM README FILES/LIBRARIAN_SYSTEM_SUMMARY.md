# Librarian Narrative System Summary

## Overview
The Librarian (NarrativeAssembler) transforms structured section data into polished narratives for Mission Debrief. It now consumes live evidence enrichments, manifest snapshots, and case analytics, assembling court-safe narratives that reflect the latest locker state and SectionBusAdapter outputs while mirroring mission progress back to the Ecosystem Controller.

## Core Responsibilities
- Listen for `evidence.updated`, `section.data.updated`, `gateway.section.complete`, and `case.snapshot` signals, capturing the freshest payloads per section.
- Assemble narratives using section templates, manifest context, and ECC-approved messaging, applying court-safe phrasing and compliance checks.
- Queue high-priority sections when enrichment arrives, emit `narrative.assembled` and `mission_debrief.section.update`, and archive results for Mission Debrief Manager and Archive Manager workflows.
- Feed mission telemetry (`mission.status`) with narrative completeness, outstanding dependencies, and analytics generated from enrichment activity.

## Integration Highlights
- **Bus Registration:** `_register_with_bus()` now registers for evidence enrichments and case snapshots in addition to section lifecycle topics.
- **Context Builders:** `section_updates`, `gateway_events`, `evidence_updates`, and `case_snapshots` provide consolidated manifests for the assembler, enabling cross-section references (e.g., Section 6 billing totals, Section 8 media chronology).
- **Manifest Fusion:** Narrative assembly merges structured payloads with locker manifest context and recent enrichment summaries so generated prose always reflects current evidence.
- **Status Emission:** Librarian broadcasts completion and compliance data via Warden/ECC, powering Enhanced GUI dashboards and Analyst Deck regression checks.

## Recent Enhancements
- Added handlers for `evidence.updated` and `case.snapshot` to keep narrative caches synchronized with the Evidence Locker and Gateway.
- Extended the assembler to inject manifest context, enrichment summaries, and case analytics into section templates before generating the final narrative text.
- Tightened audit logging with enriched payloads (case ID, evidence IDs, routing metadata) for traceability and QA replay.
- Coordinated with SectionBusAdapter to reuse billing and disclosure metadata, ensuring the final report narrative matches the GUI’s analytics panels.

## Operational Status
- **Completed:** Bus handler expansion, manifest fusion inside templates, archival workflow alignment, mission status integration.
- **In Progress:** Automated style-guide linting and AI-assisted phrasing recommendations.
- **Next:** Advanced compliance validation, multilingual narrative support, predictive section prioritization.
