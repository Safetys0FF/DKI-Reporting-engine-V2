# Analyst Deck System Summary

## Overview
The Analyst Deck provides investigation analytics, automated validation, and QA tooling for the Central Command ecosystem. With the latest bus-enabled updates, the deck consumes live manifest data, section enrichments, SectionBusAdapter analytics, and mission status broadcasts to drive proactive insights.

## Core Responsibilities
- Run integration and smoke tests spanning Evidence Locker, Gateway, SectionBusAdapter, Mission Debrief, and Enhanced GUI workflows.
- Analyse manifest coverage, section completion timelines, billing aggregates, and enrichment depth using bus snapshots plus locker manifest context.
- Host scenario scripts that replay `section.needs`, `evidence.request`, `evidence.updated`, and disclosure events for QA and regression coverage.
- Surface dashboards and reports that help operators gauge readiness before final assembly, including variance alerts for billing and analytics sections.

## Architectural Highlights
- **Bus-Aware Test Harness:** Exercises `DKIReportBus` interfaces to poll manifests, evidence deliveries, enrichment dedupe windows, and case snapshots.
- **Scenario Runner:** Automates evidence ingestion through SectionBusAdapter, verifying that classification handoffs, default requests, and deduplicated deliveries fire in sequence.
- **Telemetry Capture:** Ingests `mission.status`, SectionBusAdapter billing/analytics payloads, and Librarian narrative emissions for historical baselines.
- **Report Artifacts:** Generates QA summaries linking locker manifest data to final narratives and GUI billing dashboards for audit traceability.

## Recent Enhancements
- Extended regression suites to validate the new classification router, evidence delivery dedupe window, and SectionBusAdapter billing/analytics outputs.
- Added checks confirming Librarian narratives include manifest context and disclosure metadata emitted by the GUI pipeline.
- Updated dashboards to correlate locker manifest entries with Section 6/7 analytics, flagging inconsistencies before final assembly.
- Integrated disclosure catalog coverage into readiness reports, ensuring Section DP language accompanies every report build.

## Operational Status
- **Completed:** Bus snapshot integration, enrichment validation scenarios, SectionBusAdapter analytics ingestion, mission status monitoring.
- **In Progress:** Automated anomaly detection across manifest/billing trends and narrative consistency checks.
- **Next:** Predictive analytics for section duration, AI-assisted QA recommendations, cross-case trend reporting.
