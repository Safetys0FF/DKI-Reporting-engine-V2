# Section Smoke Results - 2025-09-19

Synthetic execution of `run_section_bundle_smoke.py` using the provided JSON bundles. Missing media files triggered processing warnings; manifests still render using placeholders. Summary per scenario follows.

## Scenario: simple_route

- Sections completed: 13 / 13
- Failed sections: none
- Notes:
  - Section 7 flag: Missing supporting content from Section 8
  - Section 5 placeholders: 2 fields defaulted

## Scenario: renters_focus

  - Section 5 placeholders: 3 fields defaulted

## Scenario: surveillance_only

- Sections completed: 13 / 13
- Failed sections: none
- Notes:
  - Section 7 flag: Missing supporting content from Section 8

## Scenario: intake_review

- Sections completed: 13 / 13

  - Section 5 placeholders: 3 fields defaulted

## Known Warnings

- Media test payload references image/video/audio files that are not present; media processing emitted `Media file not found` warnings.
- MoviePy is not installed, so video thumbnails were skipped (warning emitted on import).
- Section 5 currently lacks subject metadata in the documents payload, resulting in placeholder text (`*Unknown*`).
- Section 7 flagged missing supporting content from Section 8 because the synthetic manifest has no dated evidence entries.

## Follow-Up Recommendations

- Stage representative media (photos, video, audio) matching the JSON filenames to validate media analysis end-to-end.
- Populate document payloads with subject metadata to avoid placeholder fields in Section 5.
- Add evidence dates and routing in the synthetic data so Section 8 produces meaningful timelines, clearing the Section 7 flag.
- Re-run `run_section_bundle_smoke.py` after augmenting the test bundles and capture updated results for DEESCALATION.
