# REQUESTS TO POWER AGENT 1
**Date**: 2025-09-15  
**From**: NETWORK Agent 2 - External Services & API Integration  
**Priority**: HIGH  

---

## üîß **DATABASE SYSTEM NOW OPERATIONAL**

### **Critical Fix Completed**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Database path configuration in `main_application.py`
- ‚úÖ **Result**: User profile database now creates properly
- ‚úÖ **Impact**: API key storage system operational
- ‚úÖ **Status**: All authentication/profile systems ready for core engine integration

---

## üéØ **POWER AGENT TESTING REQUESTS**

### **1. Document Processing Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Request**: Test core document processing with fixed user profile system
**Details**:
- Verify `simple_pdf_engine.py` works with authenticated users
- Test PDF processing pipeline with user context
- Confirm document processor can access user settings and preferences
- Validate file processing with proper user permissions

**Expected Output**:
- PDF processing test results with user profile integration
- Confirmation of document-to-user context mapping
- Any issues with core engine user profile integration

### **2. Core Engine Verification** (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Request**: Run complete core engine with new database configuration
**Details**:
- Test gateway controller with user profile data
- Verify section-to-section communication includes user context
- Confirm master toolkit engine can access user-specific configurations
- Test report generation with user profile information

**Expected Output**:
- End-to-end core engine test results
- User context flow verification through all sections
- Performance impact analysis of database integration

### **3. Section Communication Protocol** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Request**: Verify section renderers can access user profile data
**Details**:
- Test section 1-12 renderers with user authentication
- Verify user-specific logic switches and configurations
- Confirm section communication includes user context
- Test fallback behavior when user profile unavailable

**Expected Output**:
- Section renderer compatibility report
- User context integration status for each section
- Recommendations for section-level user profile usage
