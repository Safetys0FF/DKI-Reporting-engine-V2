# POWER Change Summary — 2025-09-15

Purpose: Provide a clear record of WHAT changed, HOW it changed, and WHERE it changed to support fast, reliable handoffs.

---

## What Changed
- Section 6 renderer now generates correctly and matches Gateway API.
- Billing title normalized to ASCII and bullets standardized.
- Handshake debriefs added for NETWORK and DEESCALATION.
- Handshake workflow standardized with CLI and templates.
- Extended smoke tests and export validation added.

## How It Changed
- Implemented `render_model(...)` in the Section 6 renderer to return a structured `render_tree` (title, headers, fields, paragraphs) aligned with other section renderers. Added Surveillance≡Field mapping and safe defaults when budget inputs are absent.
- Replaced non-ASCII glyphs in the Section 6 title and notes with ASCII equivalents to avoid encoding issues in logs/exports.
- Authored concise debrief handshakes pointing to smoke artifacts and activity log.
- Created a small handshake CLI that generates Requests/ACKs/Confirms/Debriefs from templates and auto-links them in the daily handoffs file for visibility.
- Added scripts to exercise full section flow (signals 10-6/10-8/10-4/10-9/10-10) and export RTF/DOCX/PDF from compiled sections.

## Where (Files Updated/Added)
- Updated: `section_6_renderer.py`
  - Added: `render_model(...)` to provide Gateway-compatible output
  - Normalized: Title text to "SECTION 6 - BILLING SUMMARY"
  - Notes bullets: replaced odd glyph with "- "
- Added: `dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-15_POWER_DEBRIEF_to_NETWORK.md`
- Added: `dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-15_POWER_DEBRIEF_to_DEESCALATION.md`
- Added: `dev_tracking/handshake_cli.py`
- Added templates:
  - `dev_tracking/templates/handshakes/request.md`
  - `dev_tracking/templates/handshakes/ack.md`
  - `dev_tracking/templates/handshakes/confirm.md`
  - `dev_tracking/templates/handshakes/debrief.md`
  - `dev_tracking/templates/session_log.md`
- Added smoke utilities:
  - `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py`
  - `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/export_rtf_smoke.py`

## Verification (Key Results)
- Extended smoke: All sections generated; Section 6 unblocked. Signals present (10-6/10-8/10-4/10-9/10-10).
  - `dev_tracking/SMOKE_RUN_RESULTS_EXTENDED.json`
- API keys E2E: Round-trip success at `DKI_Repository/user_profiles.db`.
- Exports produced: RTF, DOCX, PDF at `DKI_Repository/exports/smoke_report_*.{rtf,docx,pdf}`.
- Activity log: `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/POWER_ACTIVITY_LOG_2025-09-15.md` updated with details.

## Notes
- Toolkit warnings during smoke (mileage artifacts path, BillingTool defaults) are benign and do not block section generation.
- No scope expansion: AI/OSINT features remain out-of-scope per directive.
