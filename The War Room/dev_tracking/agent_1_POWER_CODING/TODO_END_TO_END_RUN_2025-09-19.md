# TODO – End-to-End Report Run (2025-09-19)
1. Stage test case in `DKI_Repository/cases/test_run`: intake.json, contracts, logs, mileage JSON, media.
2. Load API keys (ChatGPT, Gemini, Maps) via Start Menu dialog; confirm `.venv` Whisper/librosa by running voice check.
3. Run toolkit unit scripts (billing, mileage, metadata, cochran, OSINT) using staged data; cache outputs under case directory.
4. Execute document/media processors to populate case outputs; validate schemas with parsing maps.
5. Walk UI section approvals in architect order, documenting adjustments/notes per section.
6. Trigger Issue pipeline (final assembly, signature, packaging, dispatch log) and archive exports.
7. Log results & request DEESCALATION/NETWORK validation sweep.
