# POWER Agent Session Log ? 2025-09-16

## Terminal Issue Recovery Progress
- Captured baseline interpreter details (`python --version`, `where.exe python`, `sys.executable`) to document the active Python 3.13.7 installation.
- Verified the original interpreter lacked `librosa` (`ModuleNotFoundError`).
- Created isolated virtual environment `dki_env` at the project root and installed `librosa`, `soundfile`, and `ffmpeg-python` (plus transitive dependencies).
- Re-ran capability probes via `dki_env` interpreter; `MediaProcessingEngine.capabilities['audio_analysis']` now resolves `True` while terminal output remains responsive.
- Executed voice readiness smoke script confirming "Voice recognition ready" with audio analysis enabled; captured command outputs for handoff reporting.

## Voice Memo & Transcription Integration
- Added Whisper dependency (`openai-whisper`) and new `voice_transcription.py` utility to manage offline transcription (file and in-memory array ingestion).
- Extended `media_processing_engine.py` to expose voice transcription capability, capture transcripts for audio-only uploads and embedded video audio, and normalize transcription metadata.
- Updated `document_processor.py`, `main_application.py`, and `gateway_controller.py` to propagate audio clip metadata and transcripts through processing, ensuring Section payloads receive structured voice memo entries.
- Enhanced Section 3, 4, and 8 renderers to surface voice memo content, summarize transcripts, and include audio counts in manifests alongside images/videos.

## Next Actions
- Evaluate whether to standardize on `dki_env` for upcoming media-focused validations.
- Coordinate with NETWORK agent on remaining media dependency coverage (cv2/moviepy) if additional tests are required.
- Prepare handshake follow-up summarizing diagnostic results and residual gaps.

## API Key Dialog Stabilization
- Accepted NETWORK handoff for pagination failure impacting `api_key_dialog.py`; dialog was hanging and blocking the UI.
- Replaced pagination logic with a scrollable single-page form showing all required services and prefilling stored keys from the profile manager.
- Simplified navigation controls (Save/Cancel only) to eliminate widget lifecycle churn observed in the failing pagination build.
- Added vertical scrollbar support so future additions do not require pagination while keeping the dialog responsive.
- Addressed API key dialog feedback: adjusted window size/scrollable area and ensured all required fields?including Copilot, ChatGPT/OpenAI, and Google Maps?render with correct labels.
- Updated `api_key_dialog.py`: expanded required service list, refined labels, kept scrollable layout, and ensured prefills remain intact.
- Updated `main_application.py`: dialog now always requests the full required set so missing keys are surfaced even if previously blank.

## Case Workflow Hardening
- Synchronized the section dropdown with `GatewayController.report_types` and added automatic gateway initialization when cases are created, loaded, or before processing/generation.
- Persisted case metadata (`case_metadata`, `case_id`) in `main_application.py` so saves/loads reconstruct state without manual intervention.
- Refreshed installation instructions and dependency requirements across SOP, PRD, BUILD_BLUEPRINT, and README to highlight `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, Copilot support, and the new initialization flow.

## Handoff
- Coordination summary for DEESCALATION: `dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-16_POWER_Status_Case_Workflow.md` (UI/gateway alignment completed; ready for regression review).
