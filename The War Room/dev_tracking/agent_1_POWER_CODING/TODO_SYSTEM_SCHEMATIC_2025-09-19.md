# To-Do – System Schematic & Change Dispatch (2025-09-19)

1. Enumerate directory tree for `F:\DKI-Report-Engine\Report Engine` capturing relative paths and timestamps.
2. Compile results into `SYSTEM_SCHEMATIC_2025-09-18.md` under `dev_tracking/archives`.
3. Detect deltas versus prior schematic (if any) and document additions/removals/renames in `CHANGE_DISPATCH_2025-09-18.md`.
4. Set both outputs read-only for audit log.
5. Emit follow-up handshake notifying NETWORK + DEESCALATION once files are published.
