# Start-of-Day Tasks – 2025-09-19

## Next Step Summary
- Review of logs, handshakes, archives complete; queued readiness checks for POWER scope.
- Prior work focused on path reconfiguration (see `dev_tracking/logs/PATH_REMAP_ACTIONS_2025-09-19.md`); today's focus is validation and readiness.

## Daily Goals
- Run `smoke_harness.py` (POWER suite) to confirm prior repairs and installations.
- Calibrate section renderers and verify OCR threshold ≥ 0.85 once smoke run passes.
- Log readiness update to handshakes (`dev_tracking/Handshakes`).
- Maintain monitoring of Archives for any new change directives.
