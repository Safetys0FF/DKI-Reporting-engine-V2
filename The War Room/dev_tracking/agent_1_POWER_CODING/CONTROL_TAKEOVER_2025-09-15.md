# CONTROL TAKEOVER — 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Context
- Taking control as POWER agent per SOP. No coding yet; coordination and planning only at this stage.

ACK Summary
- ACKed NETWORK → POWER (standard, autonomous, critical) handshakes.
- ACKed DEESCALATION → ALL (critical issues) handshake.

Immediate Focus (Planning Only)
- Define test plan for user-profile-integrated document processing.
- Finalize Phase A standardization scope for 12 core configs.
- Draft logging fix approach for `run_dki_engine.py` (Unicode-safe).
- Sequence autonomous foundations (design): report-type auto-detect, contract intelligence, section communication bus, document classifier.

Next Coordination Steps
- Await NETWORK and DEESCALATION confirmations on proposals and quality gates.
- Update DAILY_HANDOFFS_2025-09-15.md with status and planned deliverables.

Status: CONTROLLED (POWER), NON-CODING PHASE
