# FULL SYSTEM SCAN AND PLAN — 2025-09-14 (Read-Only)

Summary
- Scope aligns to manifest: see `dev_tracking/archives/CORE_OPERATIONS_HANDBOOK.md` (authoritative 12 core files). Fallback and toolkit indexes consulted.
- System is operational; key risks remain in the 12 core configs (duplications, emitter/payload mismatches, description/format anomalies).

Snapshot (logic root)
- Root: C:\Users\DTKra\OneDrive\Desktop\DKI Engine\logic
- Python files: 58
- Python total lines: ~21,508
- Top modules by lines (approx):
  - gateway_controller.py (~1,042)
  - main_application.py (~1,479)
  - media_processing_engine.py (~911)
  - watermark_system.py (~903)
  - report_generator.py (~878)
  - digital_signature_system.py (~818)
  - interface_manager.py (~796)
  - template_system.py (~747)
- Text configuration files: 29 (includes the 12 core configs and logic references)

What’s Right
- Orchestration: Gateway Controller provides clear sequencing and signals; toolkit-first flow; Section 8 media path.
- Renderers: CP, TOC, 7, 8, 9 are stable, with graceful error fallbacks.
- Toolkit: Billing, Cochran identity match, Metadata, Mileage, North Star classification are deterministic and testable.

What’s Wrong (Core Configs)
- Duplicate `gateway_section_control` header blocks in multiple files (Sections 2–8, DP, FR).
- Emitter block names mismatched to section (e.g., Sections 7/8 using `section_3_toolkit_signal_emitter`).
- Payload mismatches: `origin`/`from` fields not set to the hosting section id in some files.
- Description copy errors (e.g., Section 4 mentions Section 3).
- Risk of repeated `logic_switches` and endpoint blocks; enforce one per file.
- Prior YAML-like syntax defects (extra quote/missing colon) require a follow-up validation pass.

Constructive Building Projections
- Validator: Add a lightweight pre-run validator for the 12 core configs (duplicate top-level keys, emitter/id alignment, payload sanity, simple syntax checks).
- Logic Profiles: Extract per-section “profiles” from fallback docs to auto-check labels, roles, and key expectations.
- Resilience: Harden renderer inputs (type/shape guards) and keep non-ASCII output out of logs/prints.
- Media Pathing: Optional async/batch toggles for Section 8 media processing; cache across sections.
- CI Hooks: Introduce config validation into build (pre-run) to block regressions.

Organized Plan (Repairs/Builds)
1) Phase 1 — Mechanical Standardization (low risk)
   - Remove duplicate header blocks in the 12 configs.
   - Normalize emitter ids to `section_<id>_toolkit_signal_emitter`.
   - Set payload `origin` and `from` to the hosting section id.
   - Fix description copy errors per section.
   - Ensure exactly one `logic_switches` and one `callbox_endpoints` block per file.
2) Phase 2 — Syntax/Format Validation
   - Resolve YAML-like anomalies (quotes/colons/indent).
   - Run validator and correct flagged issues.
3) Phase 3 — Integration Alignment
   - Cross-check against `gateway_controller.py` and fallback profiles; correct mismatches.
   - Spot-check section labels vs. TOC/CP presentation.
4) Phase 4 — Tooling & CI
   - Implement the config validator; wire into pre-run/build pipeline.
   - Draft per-section Logic Profiles from fallback docs and integrate into validator.

Where to Start (POWER Agent)
- Start with Phase 1 mechanical standardization across all 12 core files.
- Document every change (what/why/where/next) in a dated read-only change record.
- Open handshakes to NETWORK (API/keys impacts) and DEESCALATION (risk validation and regression focus).
