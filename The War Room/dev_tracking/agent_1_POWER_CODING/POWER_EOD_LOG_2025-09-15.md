# POWER EOD LOG — 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Summary
- Completed Phase 1 core-config hygiene (duplicate blocks removed; emitters normalized).
- Aligned labels to fallback logic (e.g., Surveillance Section 3 → Daily Logs; Section 1 → Investigation Objectives).
- Implemented auto report-type detection in gateway_controller (None/auto + Field≡Surveillance alias).
- Hardened launcher I/O to avoid EOF in non-interactive runs; logs are ASCII-clean.
- Ran smoke harness: confirmed 10-6/10-8 signals for CP/TOC/Section 1; API key E2E passed (roundtrip true).

Files Changed (Core)
- run_dki_engine.py — sanitized logging, guarded input(), UTF-8 file handler.
- gateway_controller.py — label update (Daily Logs for Surveillance section_3), _normalize_report_type(), _infer_report_type(), initialize_case() now supports None/auto.
- 1. Section CP.txt — emitter rename and payload fixes.
- 2. Section TOC.txt — single logic_switches, sanitized misencoded string, labels adjusted (Objectives; Daily Logs).
- 4–12 core files — removed duplicated gateway headers; standardized emitter IDs/payload origins; corrected Section 4 description; de-duplicated logic_switches/callbox_endpoints.

Utilities Added
- core_config_validator.py — scans for duplicate blocks, emitter mismatches, suspicious characters.
- normalize_core_configs.py — removes duplicate top-level blocks (logic_switches keep last; callbox_endpoints keep first).
- dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/smoke_harness.py — runs API keys E2E, auto-detect validation, and minimal section generation.

Tests & Results
- Smoke pre-check (launcher): OK after deps installed (per Network debrief).
- API key E2E: DB path C:\\Users\\DTKra\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\DKI Engine\\logic\\DKI_Repository\\user_profiles.db; roundtrip_ok=True; keys_count=1.
- Auto-detect: investigative→Investigative; field→Surveillance; hybrid→Hybrid; ambiguous→Surveillance.
- Signals observed (harness): 10-6 (Toolkit Ready), 10-8 (Section Complete) for CP, TOC, Section 1.
- Full results: dev_tracking/SMOKE_RUN_RESULTS.json.

Handshakes & Logs
- EOD: dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-15_POWER_EOD.md (includes smoke results; staffing OOO).
- Network control handoff ACK: dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-15_POWER_ACK_FOR_NETWORK_HANDOFF.md.

Next Steps (Recommended)
1) Full smoke via launcher UI (CP/TOC/Section 1) to mirror harness path; verify logs and signals.
2) API key E2E via UI flow; confirm no decryption/path issues with user sessions.
3) Section communication checks across Section 1→2; exercise 10-4/10-9/10-10; confirm state transitions.
4) Performance baseline: timings and memory for launcher and section render; record in dev_tracking.
5) Optional: extend auto-detect cues and log rationale for audit clarity.

Staffing
- All agents OOO (out of office). Next updates next business day.
