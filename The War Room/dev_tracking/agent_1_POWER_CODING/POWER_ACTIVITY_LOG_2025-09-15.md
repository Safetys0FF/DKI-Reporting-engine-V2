# POWER Activity Log — 2025-09-15

Purpose: Record what was done, where, and why to progress today’s goals without expanding scope beyond “get it running”.

---

Activities

- Added handshake for DEESCALATION QC handoff
  - Where: `dev_tracking/Handshakes/HANDSHAKE_2025-09-15_POWER_to_DEESCALATION_HANDOFF.md`
  - Why: Formalize targeted QC asks (finalize 2 configs, repair change tracking, validate error paths, enforce scope) while POWER continues smoke/integration.

- Reviewed other agents’ handshakes and revised POWER plan
  - Where: Read from `dev_tracking/Handshakes/*NETWORK*to_POWER*.md`, `...DEESCALATION_to_POWER*.md`; plan updated via internal tool
  - Why: Align today’s tasks to confirmed requests (core engine testing, user-context integration, signal validation, exports) and defer out‑of‑scope AI features.

- Ran POWER smoke harness (API keys E2E, auto-detect, minimal sections)
  - Where: `python -m dev_tracking.agent_1_POWER_CODING.smoke_harness`
  - Outputs: `dev_tracking/SMOKE_RUN_RESULTS.json`
  - Why: Verify database path fix, round‑trip API key storage, and baseline section flow with signals.

- Implemented extended section smoke test script
  - Where: `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py`
  - Why: Exercise full section sequence and explicitly validate 10-4/10-6/10-8/10-9/10-10 signal emissions; capture failures early.

- Updated extended smoke to attach authenticated user profile to toolkit
  - Where: `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py`
  - Change: Initialize `UserProfileManager` at `DKI_Repository/user_profiles.db`, authenticate `smokeuser`, attach via `gc.toolkit_engine.set_user_profile_manager(upm)`.
  - Why: Ensure user context and API keys flow into toolkit and section payloads per NETWORK requests.

- Executed extended smoke
  - Where: `python -m dev_tracking.agent_1_POWER_CODING.run_section_smoke_all`
  - Outputs: `dev_tracking/SMOKE_RUN_RESULTS_EXTENDED.json`
  - Why: Validate broader section flow and signal protocol; identify blockers.

- Implemented export smoke (RTF/DOCX/PDF) using compiled sections
  - Where: `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/export_rtf_smoke.py`
  - Why: Prove export pipeline works with current deps and partial content; produce tangible artifacts for review.

- Executed export smoke and confirmed artifacts
  - Where: `python -m dev_tracking.agent_1_POWER_CODING.export_rtf_smoke`
  - Outputs: `DKI_Repository/exports/smoke_report_*.rtf`, `*.docx`, `*.pdf`
  - Why: Deliver immediate, verifiable outputs and confirm dependency health for exporters.

- Confirmed fallback logic references are foundational pre‑work
  - Where: Reviewed `dev_tracking/archives/CORE_OPERATIONS_HANDBOOK.md`
  - Why: Ensure test/coding aligns with defined fallback policies before proceeding; answered “Yes” per request.

- Fixed Section 6 Billing renderer to unblock generation
  - Where: `section_6_renderer.py`
  - Changes:
    - Added `render_model(...)` method to conform to Gateway renderer API (returns `render_tree`).
    - Treated `Surveillance` as `Field` in billing breakdown mapping.
    - Structured output with Contract Overview, Billing Breakdown, Financial Summary, Notes.
  - Why: Gateway expected `render_model` or `generate_section`; absence caused HALT at Billing Summary.

Key Results

- API keys E2E: Round‑trip save/load succeeded; DB path `DKI_Repository/user_profiles.db` confirmed.
- Auto report‑type detection: Investigative→Investigative; Field→Surveillance (alias); Hybrid→Hybrid; Ambiguous→Surveillance (fallback).
- Signals: Verified 10‑6, 10‑8, 10‑4, 10‑9, 10‑10 across runs.
- Exports: RTF/DOCX/PDF generated to `DKI_Repository/exports/`.
- Blocker found: `Section6BillingRenderer` missing required render API — causes HALT at Billing Summary.

---

Immediate Follow‑ups (POWER)

- Patch Section 6 renderer to provide `render_model(...)` (or compatible path) to unblock Billing Summary.
- Share concise debrief + artifacts with NETWORK/DEESC for validation and next steps.
