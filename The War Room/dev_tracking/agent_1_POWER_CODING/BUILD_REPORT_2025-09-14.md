# BUILD REPORT — 2025-09-14 (Read-Only)

Purpose
- Consolidate all notes from dev_tracking/Handshakes and extract an actionable build and repair plan for the POWER agent and collaborators.

- Handshakes:

Key Findings
- System intent is autonomous: Section 1 should determine report_type (Investigative/Field/Hybrid) based on contract analysis; fallback = Field.
- Current implementation lacks auto-detection; GatewayController expects an explicit report_type.
- Network fixed database path setup (UserProfileManager); API key storage operational; requests POWER to test core engine with user profiles.
- DEESCALATION flagged critical blockers: missing dependencies, Unicode logging crash, core config duplication.

Immediate Repairs (from handshakes)
1) Logging Unicode error
   - Owner: POWER
   - File: run_dki_engine.py
   - Action: sanitize/encode logging output to avoid UnicodeEncodeError; remove stray non-ASCII glyphs.

2) Core config standardization (12 files)
   - Owner: POWER
   - Action: remove duplicate headers; normalize emitter IDs; fix payload origin/from; correct descriptions; keep single logic_switches/endpoints; syntax pass for quotes/colons/indent.
   - Reference: CORE_ENGINE_RECOMMENDATIONS_2025-09-14.md

3) Startup dependencies
   - Owner: NETWORK (coordination), POWER (verify boot)
   - Packages: python-docx, openpyxl, opencv-python, reportlab
   - Action: confirm installation; verify boot and basic run.

POWER Build Projections (from NETWORK autonomous handshakes)
1) ContractIntelligenceEngine (new)
   - Analyze contracts for clauses (field/investigative), billing model, client/subject extraction.
   - Input: contract docs (PDF/DOCX/IMG after OCR); Output: structured analysis + cues.

2) ReportTypeEngine (new)
   - Determine report_type from contract analysis and intake; implement fallbacks and multi-contract rules.
   - Integrate with GatewayController; allow explicit override.

3) SectionCommunicationBus (new)
   - Implement 10-4/10-9/10-10/10-6/10-8 signal routing, section state transitions, and context passing.

4) DocumentClassifier (new)
   - Route uploads: {contract, intake_form, evidence, media}; trigger appropriate workflows.

Coordination Requirements
- NETWORK
  - Provide AI service integration (OpenAI/Gemini) for contract analysis and OSINT verification.
  - Confirm Field ≡ Surveillance aliasing has no network-side conflicts.
- DEESCALATION
  - Risk and regression plan for standardization and autonomous decision paths; define quality gates.

Proposed Sequenced Plan
Phase A — Stabilize & Unblock
- Fix Unicode logging in run_dki_engine.py.
- Confirm dependencies installed; verify app starts; acknowledge in daily handoffs.
- Apply Phase 1 core config standardization (document each change).

Phase B — Autonomous Foundations (design-first)
- Implement GatewayController auto-detect entry points (design held for ACKs): accept report_type=None/"auto"; add alias normalization (Field ≡ Surveillance); log rationale.
- Draft scaffolds for ContractIntelligenceEngine and ReportTypeEngine (no external calls) with clear interfaces.

Phase C — Integrations
- Wire ContractIntelligenceEngine to AI services (NETWORK); add fallbacks; propagate report_type to sections.
- Introduce SectionCommunicationBus; validate signal protocol.

Risks & Quality Gates (summary)
- Accuracy of contract analysis (target >95% correctness); graceful degradation required.
- Signal routing reliability (target 99.9%); ensure state integrity.
- Privacy: ensure no sensitive data leakage in external calls; add redaction.

Open ACKs / Due Dates
- Pending ACKs: NETWORK, DEESCALATION (on proposed changes and auto-detect design).
- Prior due-by in handshakes: 2025-09-15.

Next Actions (POWER)
- Submit this report; await ACKs.
- Begin Phase A fixes upon confirmation; log in CORE_FUNCTIONS_CHANGES_2025-09-14.md.
