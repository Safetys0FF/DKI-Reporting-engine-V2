# HANDSHAKE: NETWORK ‚Üí POWER (AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM)
**Date**: 2025-09-15  
**From**: NETWORK Agent 2 - External Services & API Integration  
**To**: POWER Agent 1 - Core Engine POWER Coder  
**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

---

## üß† **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**

**MAJOR FINDING**: The DKI Engine is architecturally designed as an **autonomous, intelligent system** but currently implemented as a **manual, user-driven interface**.

**Root Issue**: The system should automatically analyze uploaded contracts to determine report type, but this core intelligence is completely missing.

---

## üìã **AUTONOMOUS ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Section 1 as Logic Controller** (From Core Operations Handbook)
- **NOT** just a form renderer - it's the **primary filter for the report system**
- **SHOULD** analyze contract type and client intake data automatically
- **MUST** determine report type: Investigative/Surveillance/Hybrid based on contract analysis
- **CONTROLS** all downstream section behavior via logic switches

### **Fallback Logic Requirements** (From Section 1 logic files)
```
IF research-only + no field clause ‚Üí "Investigative Report"
IF surveillance-only + no investigative ‚Üí "Field Report"  
IF both clauses OR case escalates ‚Üí "Hybrid Report"
FALLBACK: Default to "Field" if no contract type matched
MULTIPLE CONTRACTS: Most recent rules unless hybrid pattern confirmed
```

### **Signal Protocol Architecture** (From gateway controller specs)
- **10-4**: Section approved, unlock next section
- **10-9**: Revision required, return to previous section  
- **10-10**: Emergency halt, freeze gateway
- **10-6**: Toolkit dispatched and ready
- **10-8**: Section complete, forward to next

---

## üö® **CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS**

### **1. Contract Intelligence Engine** - POWER RESPONSIBILITY
**File**: `contract_intelligence_engine.py`  
**Function**: Analyze uploaded contracts to detect:
- Contract type (investigative vs surveillance vs hybrid)
- Field work clauses presence/absence
- Billing model requirements (flat vs hourly)
- Client and subject information extraction

### **2. Report Type Logic Engine** - POWER RESPONSIBILITY  
**File**: `report_type_engine.py`  
**Function**: Implement the autonomous logic switches:
- Process contract analysis results
- Apply fallback logic rules
- Return definitive report type determination
- Handle multiple contract scenarios

### **3. Section Communication Bus** - POWER RESPONSIBILITY
**File**: `section_communication_bus.py`  
**Function**: Implement signal-based section coordination:
- Handle 10-4/10-9/10-10 signal routing
- Manage section state transitions
- Store and forward section context
- Enable automatic section progression

### **4. Document Classification System** - POWER RESPONSIBILITY
**File**: `document_classifier.py`  
**Function**: Route uploaded documents automatically:
- Classify as: contract, intake_form, evidence, media
- Route to appropriate analysis engines
- Trigger correct processing workflows

## üìä **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Autonomous Operation Test**
1. **Upload Contract**: System automatically analyzes contract type
2. **Report Type Detection**: System determines Investigative/Surveillance/Hybrid
3. **Section Activation**: Appropriate sections unlock based on report type
4. **Signal Communication**: 10-4/10-9/10-10 signals work between sections
