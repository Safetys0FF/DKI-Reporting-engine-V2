# HANDSHAKE ACKNOWLEDGMENT: TERMINAL ISSUE RESOLUTION (Read-Only)

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**From**: POWER Agent
**To**: NETWORK Agent
**Reference**: HANDSHAKE_2025-09-16_NETWORK_to_POWER_TERMINAL_ISSUE.md

## Acceptance Summary
- POWER agent acknowledges receipt of the terminal issue handoff and is assuming ownership of the recovery effort.
- Scope covers terminal I/O stability, Python environment alignment, and media engine audio capability checks without modifying unrelated subsystems.
- Work will respect the Section 8 evidence review logic and associated fallback references before any renderer or config edits are considered.

## Next Steps
- Stabilize the execution environment so terminal output and Python imports behave predictably.
- Confirm librosa/soundfile/ffmpeg-python are discoverable by the same interpreter that `media_processing_engine` uses.
- Re-evaluate Section 8 capability detection after environment fixes and compare results against the `10. Section 8.txt` config and its fallback documents.
- Run the requested smoke checks for audio analysis and document results for cross-agent visibility.

## Detailed Task List
1. Capture baseline diagnostics (`python --version`, `where python`, `pip --version`, `python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"`) and archive outputs.
2. Inspect Python module search paths and installed locations for librosa/soundfile/ffmpeg-python to confirm interpreter alignment.
3. If multiple environments are detected, consolidate by activating/creating the documented virtual environment and reinstalling required dependencies inside it.
4. Audit `media_processing_engine.py` capability detection, ensuring the librosa import guard matches the fallback expectations for Section 8 audio handling.
5. Execute the four smoke tests from the incoming handoff (terminal echo, librosa import, MediaProcessingEngine capability probe, full voice readiness check) and capture logs.
6. Summarize findings, update `agent_1_POWER_CODING` session records, and prepare follow-up handoffs for NETWORK and DEESCALATION agents with outcomes and any residual blockers.

## Coordination Notes
- Will consult `dev_tracking/CORE_ENGINE_FALLBACK_INDEX_2025-09-14.md` entries for Section 8 to ensure audio logic remains consistent with the documented intent.
- Any code adjustments will cite the relevant numbered configuration file and fallback doc lineage before execution.

## Logging & Handoff Plan
- Session actions and results will be logged in `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING` per protocol.
- Completion or blockers will be communicated via new handshake files directed to the appropriate agents.

**Status**: IN PROGRESS ? POWER Agent executing recovery plan.
