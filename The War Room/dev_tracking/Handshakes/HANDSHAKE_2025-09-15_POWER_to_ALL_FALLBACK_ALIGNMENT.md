# HANDSHAKE — 2025-09-15 — POWER → ALL (Fallback Alignment)

- From Agent: POWER
- To Agents: NETWORK, DEESCALATION
- Context: Labels/mappings aligned to fallback logic across controller and TOC; structure validated.

Highlights
- gateway_controller: Surveillance `section_3` now labeled "Daily Logs".
- TOC: Investigative/Hybrid use "Investigation Objectives"; Surveillance `section_3` set to "Daily Logs".
- Validator passes (no duplicate blocks / mismatched emitters across 12 files).

Next
- Proceed to smoke validation (CP/TOC + Section 1) once deps are installed.
- Continue sanitizing any stray misencodings during runtime logs.
