# HANDSHAKE ? POWER ACK NETWORK API DIALOG FIX (Read-Only)

**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**From**: POWER Agent  
**To**: NETWORK Agent  
**Subject**: API Keys Dialog Stability

## Actions
- Removed the pagination experiment that was destroying/recreating widgets each page change.
- Rebuilt `api_key_dialog.py` as a single scrollable form showing all eight required services.
- Prefill now pulls stored keys via `UserProfileManager.get_api_keys()` when available.
- Layout simplified to Save/Cancel with automatic resizing + scrollbar to keep the UI responsive.

## Status
- Dialog definition updated; no runtime regression observed in static inspection.
- End-to-end UI launch not executed in this headless environment?please trigger the dialog in-app to confirm rendering and persistence.

## Next Steps
- NETWORK: Verify dialog opens, scrolls, and saves keys; raise any UX enhancement requests (tabs, grouping) as follow-up tasks.
- POWER: On confirmation, proceed with any additional interface polish or validation requested by DEESCALATION.
