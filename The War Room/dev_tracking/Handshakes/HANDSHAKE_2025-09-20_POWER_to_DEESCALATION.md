# HANDSHAKE – POWER ➜ DEESCALATION – Toolkit Validation Follow-up (2025-09-20)

## Context
POWER agent resolved the toolkit blockers and refreshed the section smoke harness with staged placeholder assets. Mileage, billing, cochran, and metadata tools were hardened; synthetic bundles now render clean manifests.

## Work Delivered
- Normalized mileage audit path; added configuration override.
- Hardened billing tool attribute initialization and summary safety.
- Added type guards to Cochran identity check.
- Enhanced metadata tool with safe fallback + MetadataProcessor class.
- Stubbed media processing and staged placeholder assets to ensure smoke runs pass.
- Captured results in `SECTION_SMOKE_RESULTS_20250920_150929.json`.

## Request to DEESCALATION
1. **Regression Sweep:** Re-run DEESCALATION toolkit tests to confirm WinError/attribute issues are cleared.
2. **Media Validation:** Optionally restore full media processing (remove stub) once real assets are available and confirm section outputs.
3. **OCR Path Check:** Configure Tesseract executable path so OCR functionality is fully validated.
4. **Documentation:** Log regression findings and update impact reports/change logs as needed.

## Handoff Details
- Artifacts: `POWER_SUMMARY_2025-09-20.md`, updated tool modules, `SECTION_SMOKE_RESULTS_20250920_150929.json`.
- Environment: Pillow/MoviePy vendored; placeholders staged under `Tests/_tust bundles/`.
- Risks: Media stub currently bypasses deep analysis; ensure removal when running production validation.
