# HANDSHAKE ? POWER Status Update: Case Initialization & UI Sync (Read-Only)

**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**From**: POWER Agent  
**To**: NETWORK & DEESCALATION Agents  
**Subject**: Case workflow stabilization

## Highlights
- `main_application.py` now initializes the gateway controller whenever cases are created or loaded, stores case metadata, and pulls canonical section names directly from `GatewayController.report_types`.
- Section generation no longer throws `Unknown section`?dropdown values are synced with internal IDs, and the gateway is re-initialized automatically before processing and generation.
- Saved cases persist metadata (`case_metadata`, `case_id`) so reloading reconstructs state without manual fixes.
- Documentation (SOP, PRD, Blueprint, README) updated with dependency requirements, new API key coverage (Copilot), and the auto-initialization flow.

## Follow-up
- Verify end-to-end flows on a fresh environment after running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Let POWER know if additional UI adjustments (dialog minimum sizes, grouping) are desired.
