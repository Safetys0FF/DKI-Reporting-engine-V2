# HANDSHAKE ? POWER to ALL: Voice Memo Integration (Read-Only)

**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**From**: POWER Agent  
**To**: NETWORK & DEESCALATION Agents  
**Scope**: Audio transcription pipeline for voice notes/voice memos

## Summary
- Added Whisper-backed transcription utility and enabled media engine voice capabilities across audio uploads and embedded video audio streams.
- Document processor, main application, and gateway controller now retain audio clip artifacts and propagate transcripts through section payloads.
- Section 3, Section 4, and Section 8 renderers render voice memo summaries with language/duration metadata; manifests extended with audio counts for downstream audits.

## Files Touched
- `requirements.txt`
- `voice_transcription.py`
- `media_processing_engine.py`
- `document_processor.py`
- `main_application.py`
- `gateway_controller.py`
- `section_3_renderer.py`
- `section_4_renderer.py`
- `section_8_renderer.py`

## Tests / Validation
- `python -m compileall voice_transcription.py media_processing_engine.py document_processor.py main_application.py gateway_controller.py section_3_renderer.py section_4_renderer.py section_8_renderer.py`

## Next Steps / Requests
- NETWORK: confirm external media dependencies (cv2/moviepy) coverage for full media capability reporting and advise if additional installs required in shared environment.
- DEESCALATION: review voice memo rendering for compliance with fallback expectations; flag any regression risks for Section 3/4 narratives.
- POWER: monitor UI flows to ensure login/profile flows expose audio uploads without regressions; evaluate further UX presentation once transcripts validated.
