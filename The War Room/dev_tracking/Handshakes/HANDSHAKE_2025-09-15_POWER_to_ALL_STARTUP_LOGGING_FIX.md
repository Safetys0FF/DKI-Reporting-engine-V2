- From Agent: POWER
- To Agents: NETWORK, DEESCALATION
- Context: Critical startup fix applied to remove Unicode logging crash and invalid f-strings in the engine launcher.

Change Summary
- File: run_dki_engine.py
- Fix: Sanitized all prints/logs (ASCII-only), corrected invalid f-strings, added utf-8 file handler encoding.
- Goal: Ensure the engine can start and log cleanly once dependencies are present.
