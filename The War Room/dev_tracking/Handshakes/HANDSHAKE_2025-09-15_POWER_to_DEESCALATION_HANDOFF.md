# HANDSHAKE: POWER → DEESCALATION (Targeted QC Handoff)
**Date**: 2025-09-15  
**From**: POWER Agent 1 — Core Engine Functions  
**To**: DEESCALATION Agent 3 — Quality Control  
**Status**: REQUESTED — Awaiting DEESCALATION ACK

---

## Handoff Summary

- Purpose: Request DEESCALATION to lead targeted quality-control tasks while POWER continues core engine smoke and integration testing.
- Context: NETWORK completed dependency installation and requested control transfer; POWER acknowledged and resumed core testing. Config standardization is 10/12 complete; startup logging is fixed. Mission directive remains: no new features — focus on getting the system running.

---

## Completed (Context for Review)

- Launcher hardening: Unicode-safe logging; f-strings corrected; clean startup achieved (`run_dki_engine.py`).
- Core config standardization: 10/12 core files normalized and validated via config validators.
- Smoke readiness: Engine starts; remaining work is section validation and user-context checks.

## Requested DEESCALATION Actions

1) Finalize core config standardization (CRITICAL)
- Files: `2. Section TOC.txt`, `3. Section 1=gateway controller.txt`
- Apply same normalization pattern as the completed 10 files; ensure labels, mappings, and fallback logic are consistent.

2) Repair change/logging tracking (HIGH)
- Clear duplicates in `change_log.json` (if present), ensure file modification tracking is active, and progress logs capture completed work accurately.

3) Error-handling validation (MEDIUM)
- Exercise failure scenarios (invalid inputs, missing docs, permission issues) and confirm graceful degradation and recoverability; document gaps and recommended fixes.

4) Mission compliance gate (HIGH)
- Enforce “no new features; just get it running.” Flag any scope creep (AI/OSINT/autonomous features) and recommend disablement or guardrails where needed.

---

## Success Criteria

- 12/12 core configs validated by validators and through section-level smoke tests.
- Logging and change tracking are accurate; no duplicate/omitted entries.
- Error paths degrade gracefully with actionable logs; recovery steps documented.
- Scope compliance affirmed; any out-of-scope features gated or disabled.

---

## Dependencies and Inputs Provided

- Dependencies installed per NETWORK; engine launches without dependency errors.
- Validators: `core_config_validator.py` and normalization utilities available.
- Configuration set: the 10 standardized core files in repo root (Sections CP, 2–8, DP, Final Assembly).

---

## Timeline and Coordination

- Proposed due: 2025-09-16 EOD.
- Coordination: POWER continues smoke/integration tests in parallel and stands by for questions; NETWORK on standby for environment/performance baselining support.

---

## ACK Request

Please reply with:
- ACK: Accepted / Needs Clarification / Rejected
- Start time and any constraints
- Clarifying questions or risks
