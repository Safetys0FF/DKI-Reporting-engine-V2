# POWER – SESSION LOG – 2025-09-19

## Summary
Refined the gateway pipeline so Sections CP through FR receive normalized case metadata, toolkit outputs, and voice memo transcripts in line with the architect playbook.

## Work Performed
- Replaced ad-hoc payload assembly with `_build_section_specific_payload` helpers covering sections 1-9, CP, TOC, DP, and FR.
- Normalized voice memo handling by persisting audio transcripts in `processed_data` and injecting them into surveillance sections.
- Added shared extractors (addresses, routines, timeline snapshots, toolkit summaries) so renderers consume consistent structured inputs.
- Logged status update highlighting the new flow and remaining validation tasks.

## Artifacts
- `app/gateway_controller.py`
- `dev_tracking/logs/STATUS_UPDATE_2025-09-19_POWER.md`

## Issues/Risks
- Section parsing maps still describe the pre-refactor data contracts; reviewers may see mismatches until they are refreshed.
- No regression run yet — section smoke harness and UI validation remain pending.

## Next Steps
- Execute `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/smoke_harness.py` with a representative case bundle.
- Update parsing map docs to align with the new payload builders and toolkit expectations.
- Capture screenshots/manifests for DEESCALATION review once smoke passes.
