# Daily Work Report – 2025-10-01

## Overview
- Integrated narrative review tooling upgrades into the enhanced Central Command GUI.
- Focused on turning the Review tab from a passive display into an interactive space that can summarize section payloads and ad-hoc documents.

## Key Changes
- Command Center/UI/enhanced_functional_gui.py
  - Added persistent state for review summaries (eview_summary_text, current_review_payload) so the tab can cache bus payloads and analyst edits.
  - Reworked the detail pane to include an **Auto Summary** panel, Summarize Draft button, and a new Scan Document… control that uploads a selection to the bus and renders the return payload.
  - Implemented summary helper pipeline (_collect_summary_points, _normalize_summary_value, _generate_auto_summary, _extract_summary_sentences) to mine mission-debrief payloads and narrative drafts for highlight bullets.
  - Added _scan_document_for_summary and _extract_summary_from_response to call the existing scan_evidence endpoint and format any summary content that comes back from the locker/gateway toolchain.
  - Ensured review refresh logic records the active payload and drives the summary/status widgets whenever a section is selected or new bus traffic arrives.

## Functional Result
- Review tab now shows readiness, auto-generated highlight bullets, and manual draft text for the active section.
- Analysts can click **Summarize Draft** to build a quick synopsis of mission outputs or **Scan Document…** to push any supporting file through the evidence pipeline and capture its summary directly in the GUI.
- Status bar/log entries track summary generation, and summaries persist per session until the payload changes.

## Verification
- python -m py_compile enhanced_functional_gui.py

## Follow-up / Recommendations
1. Decide whether analyst-generated summaries should be written back to Mission Debrief so they appear in downstream Assembly exports.
2. Consider adding toast/alert feedback when the bus returns no summary so users know whether a retry is necessary.
3. Plan integration tests that simulate scan_evidence responses to validate the UI flow without relying on live bus traffic.
