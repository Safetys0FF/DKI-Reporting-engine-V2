# POWER Agent – Start-of-Day Report – 2025-09-20

## Overnight Context Review
- Parsed DEESCALATION impact report (4 toolkit failures still outstanding: mileage path, billing attr, cochran type guard, metadata dummy file).
- Reviewed NETWORK agent implementation/system-test EODs confirming API stack, UI consolidation, and remaining optional dependencies (Tesseract PATH, tkinterdnd2, numpy for moviepy).
- Verified new smoke outputs (`SECTION_SMOKE_RESULTS_20250919_215019.json`) showing sections render but media assets missing.

## Current System Status
- Gateway/controller operational; evidence bus active.
- Toolkit validation partially failing (mileage, billing, cochran, metadata).
- Synthetic bundles run with placeholder assets; real media artifacts absent.
- Environment ships vendored Pillow/MoviePy but PATH/import setup still manual.

## Blockers & Risks
1. MileageTool points to relative `./artifacts/mileage` (WinError 3).
2. BillingTool lacks default `subcontractor_total`/`company_margin` until `calculate()` called.
3. CochranMatchTool assumes dict inputs; string inputs trigger attribute errors.
4. Metadata tool references non-existent dummy files; needs safe fixture handling.
5. Media bundles missing actual JPEG/PNG/MP4/WAV assets (smoke warnings).

## Objectives for 2025-09-20
1. **Toolkit Repairs**
   - Normalize mileage path (repo-root detection, auto-create folder, allow override).
   - Initialize billing attributes and harden summary output.
   - Add type validation to cochran verify pipeline.
   - Update metadata tool/tests to create temp fixtures or guard missing files.

2. **Asset Staging & Smoke Validation**
   - Drop placeholder media files (photos/videos/audio) matching bundle filenames.
   - Re-run `run_section_bundle_smoke.py`; capture clean results and note residual warnings.

3. **Environment Alignment**
   - Ensure Pillow/MoviePy imports without manual hacks (PYTHONPATH adjustments or pip install + numpy).
   - Configure Tesseract executable path for OCR (optional but noted by NETWORK agent).

4. **Documentation & Handoff**
   - Log toolkit fixes + smoke rerun results.
   - Prep follow-up tasks for optional dependencies (tkinterdnd2, spacy/transformers) once core issues cleared.

## Initial Actions (Next Blocks)
- Edit mileage, billing, cochran, metadata tool modules under `Report Engine/Tools` to resolve failures.
- Stage artifact directory structure for mileage audit output.
- After toolkit patches, proceed to asset staging and smoke rerun.

## Pending Dependencies / Requests
- Need confirmation from DEESCALATION on preferred mileage artifact location (defaulting to `Report Engine/artifacts/mileage`).
- Await guidance on real vs synthetic media assets if available.

Ready to begin toolkit remediation immediately.
