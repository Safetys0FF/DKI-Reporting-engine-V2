# CORE CONFIG STANDARDIZATION â€” 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Scope
- Mechanical, low-risk standardization across core configuration files to remove duplicates and align emitter IDs/payloads.

Changes
- 1. Section CP.txt
  - Renamed emitter to `section_cp_toolkit_signal_emitter`.
  - Set payload origin/from to `section_cp`; updated log line.
- 4. Section 2.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block directly under `section_id: section_2`.
- 5. Section 3.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
  - Standardized logic_switches labels to "Investigation Details" for all report types.
  - Corrected emitter payload origin/from to `section_3`.
- 6. Section 4.txt
  - Fixed description to "Gateway interface for Section 4".
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
  - Renamed emitter to `section_4_toolkit_signal_emitter`; set payload origin/from to `section_4`.
- 7. Section 5.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
  - Renamed emitter to `section_5_toolkit_signal_emitter`; set payload origin/from to `section_5`; updated log line.
- 8. Section 6 - Billing Summary.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
- 9. Section 7.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
  - Renamed emitter to `section_7_toolkit_signal_emitter`.
- 10. Section 8.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
  - Renamed emitter to `section_8_toolkit_signal_emitter`.
- 11. Section DP.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.
- 12. Final Assembly.txt
  - Removed duplicated gateway header block.

Rationale
- Duplicate header blocks and mismatched emitter naming/payloads cause routing ambiguity and parsing issues.
- These corrections align with the manifest and section IDs, without changing business logic.

Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1 with any remaining duplicates or syntax anomalies (quotes/colons/indent) after review.
- Proceed to syntax validation pass and integration checks against `gateway_controller.py`.
