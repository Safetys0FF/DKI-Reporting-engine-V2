Key changes:
 1. Added AIOrchestrator to coordinate OpenAI document/image enrichment and caching.
 2. Wired orchestrator through central_plugin so EvidenceManager enriches evidence on validation.
 3. Surface AI analysis + case updates in GUI; merge into case_context and section data.
 4. Hardened profile picture loader (path check + context manager) to eliminate file descriptor errors.
 5. Contract matcher now skips non-PDF artifacts to avoid PyPDF warnings.
 6. EvidenceManager logs AI outcomes (status/message) for visibility when quota issues arise.

Outstanding / blockers:
 - OpenAI key currently returns HTTP 429 (insufficient_quota); enrichment calls are skipped until quota restored.
 - Vision/document analysis fall back gracefully, but no alternate provider configured yet.

Next suggested steps:
 - Restore OpenAI quota or supply alternate key; rerun evidence batch to populate AI fields.
 - Verify GUI AI annotations and case context merging once quota available.
 - Optionally configure secondary provider in api_config.json for resiliency.

Evidence of manual tests: python -m compileall on touched modules (ai_orchestrator, evidence_manager, central_plugin, enhanced_functional_gui, matcher).
