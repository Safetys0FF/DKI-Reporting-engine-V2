Mission Debrief Manager Progress Update
========================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-24T20:27:07.136951

Summary:
- Rewired mission_debrief_manager to initialise adapter layer for evidence, extraction, API, generator, signature, watermark, and printing tools.
- Hardened ECC/bus orchestration and tool status reporting with clean ASCII logging.
- Added adapter-driven processing pipeline covering export, watermark, signature, and print options with graceful fallbacks.

Work Location:
- F:\The Central Command\Command Center\Mission Debrief\Debrief\README\mission_debrief_manager.py

Next Steps:
1. Run Mission Debrief test harness to validate adapter wiring and error handling.
2. Evaluate ArchiveManager persistence enhancements for new metadata artefacts.
3. Surface adapter-driven capabilities in the UI/profile menus and update dependency notes.
