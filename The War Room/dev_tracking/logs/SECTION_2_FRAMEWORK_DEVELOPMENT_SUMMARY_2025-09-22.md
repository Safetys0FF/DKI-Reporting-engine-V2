## Technical Implementation

### 1. Framework Architecture
- **Base Class**: `Section2Framework` extending `SectionFramework`
- **Section ID**: `section_2_planning`
- **Max Reruns**: 2
- **Stages**: 6-stage processing pipeline (intake, verify, analyze, validate, publish, monitor)

### 2. Variable Whitelist System
```python
ecc_whitelist = {
    "subsections": ["2A", "2B", "2C", "2D", "2E"],  # Dynamic subsection selection
    "ethics_statement": "subcontractor_pre",  # Ethics statement type
    "billing_model": "hourly",  # Billing model selection
    "content_suppression": ["surveillance_logs"]  # Content to suppress
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Content Generation
- **Adaptive Headings**: Based on case mode (investigative/field/hybrid)
- **Subsection Selection**: ECC-determined based on evidence types
- **Content Suppression**: Dynamic based on case requirements
- **Ethics Statements**: Subcontractor vs owner-operator logic

### 4. Tool Integration
- **North Star Protocol Tool**: Asset classification and validation
- **Cochran Match Tool**: Identity verification with 92% similarity threshold
- **Reverse Continuity Tool**: 10 continuity validation triggers
- **Metadata Tool V5**: Multi-toolchain metadata extraction
- **Mileage Tool V2**: Billing compliance with tolerance checks

### 5. Reporting Structure (2A-2E)
- **2A**: Case Summary (5 sentences max, objective facts)
- **2B**: Verified Subjects & Data Points
- **2C**: Subject Habits, Patterns, and POIs
- **2D**: Supporting Visuals/Intel
- **2E**: Final Planning Statement with ethics/licensing

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ECC Integration
- **Section-aware execution** enforcement
- **ECC validation** before all operations
- **Completion notification** to ECC
- **Whitelist-driven** content selection

### 2. Standardized Communication Flow
```python
def publish(self, payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # 1. ECC validation
    if self.ecc:
        if not self.ecc.can_run(self.SECTION_ID):
            raise Exception(f"Section {self.SECTION_ID} not active for publishing")
    
    # 2. Generate narrative (Section-specific)
    # 3. Create result package
    # 4. Gateway publishing
    # 5. ECC completion notification
    # 6. Signal emission (standardized)
```

### 3. Dynamic Whitelist Processing
- **ECC pre-processes** evidence and determines content structure
- **Section 2 executes** only pre-determined subsections
- **Dynamic renderer** adapts to whitelist requirements
- **Content suppression** based on evidence types

### 4. Subcontractor Disclosure Logic
- **Subcontractor Pre**: With hours allocation
- **Subcontractor Final**: Standard subcontractor statement
- **Owner Operator**: DKI direct operation statement
- **Dynamic selection** based on ECC analysis

## Testing Implementation
