# CORE CONFIG SYNTAX CLEANUP â€” 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Files
- 2. Section TOC.txt

Changes
- Removed the early, duplicate `logic_switches` block in favor of the comprehensive block later in the file.
- Sanitized a misencoded log string under `final_confirmation` to: `Report type undefined - check gateway logic resolution`.

Validation
- Verified all `*_toolkit_signal_emitter` IDs are consistently named across core files.
- Confirmed `callbox_endpoints` and `logic_switches` appear once in TOC (authoritative block retained).

Next
- Cross-check section IDs and labels vs `gateway_controller.py` and adjust any stragglers.
- Proceed to smoke test after dependency confirmation.
