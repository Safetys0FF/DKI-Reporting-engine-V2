# Progression Log Summary – 2025-09-18

## New Fixes Logged

- dev_tracking/path_bootstrap.py
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Agent**: POWER
  - **Change**: Ensured all DevTracking scripts call ootstrap_paths so the repository root is on sys.path automatically.
  - **Impact**: NETWORK/DEESCALATION can execute smoke and tooling scripts without environment tweaks; future DevTracking utilities should import the helper by default.

## Cross-Agent Guidance

- NETWORK: When adding diagnostics in dev_tracking/tools/, reuse ootstrap_paths(__file__) at the top of the script.
- DEESCALATION: Validate future smoke harnesses with the helper in place before flagging PATH regressions.
- All agents: Document additional uses of the helper in the change summary and handshake directories for clear handoffs.
