Mission Debrief Export Routing Update
==================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-24T21:05:49.388894

Summary:
- Redirected Mission Debrief exports to ROOT_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/DKI_Exports/Depositions with adapter-aware helpers.
- Added case-aware filename templates for FinalReport, BillingSummary, EvidenceManifest, PrintVersion, and ExportLog artifacts.
- Recorded export pipeline activity into structured log files for each run.

Work Location:
- F:\The Central Command\Command Center\Mission Debrief\Debrief\README\mission_debrief_manager.py

Next Steps:
1. Wire billing summary, evidence manifest, and print-special PDFs when upstream generators are ready.
2. Expand automated tests to cover deposition catalog generation and export log creation.
3. Integrate UI prompts to surface the new Depositions directory and artifact list.
