Mission Debrief Archival Enhancements
====================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-24T21:41:36.922472

Summary:
- Installed pytest locally and executed Mission Debrief deposition tests; suite now passes with adapter stubs.
- ArchiveManager archives include normalized deposition catalogs, export log metadata, and persisted manifests for retrieval.
- Added ArchiveManager.get_deposition_catalog plus file metadata helpers for export discovery workflows, and surfaced deposition manifest hints in listing APIs.

Work Location:
- F:\The Central Command\Command Center\Mission Debrief\Library\archive_manager.py
- F\The Central Command\Command Center\Mission Debrief\Tests\test_deposition_exports.py

Next Steps:
1. Backfill additional tests around ArchiveManager.get_deposition_catalog and retrieval flows.
2. Wire bus signals/UI to surface deposition manifest details from the archive listings.
3. Consider encrypting or signing deposition manifests for tamper detection.
