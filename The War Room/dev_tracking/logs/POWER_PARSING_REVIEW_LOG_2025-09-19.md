# POWER – SESSION LOG – 2025-09-19 PARSING REVIEW

## Summary
Reviewed Gateway, Processors, Tool kit, and engine map modules to document how each section obtains inputs, toolkit augmentation, and OpenAI checkpoints prior to refreshing parsing maps.

## Work Performed
- Catalogued section_parsing_dispatcher.py builders to map required payloads, UI checklists, and dependencies per section.
- Cross-referenced DocumentProcessor/EvidencePipeline outputs with toolkit utilities (mileage, northstar, cochran, metadata) to confirm data availability.
- Traced engine_map files and Tool kit specs for intake routing, ensuring staged artifacts match the new gateway contracts.

## Artifacts
- Gateway/section_parsing_dispatcher.py
- Processors/document_processor.py
- Tool kit/tools.py/*
- engine_map_files/BUILD_BLUEPRINT.md

## Issues/Risks
- Existing parsing map markdown files (Gateway/parsing maps) still reflect legacy fields and need updates to prevent reviewer confusion.
- Some toolkit expectations (e.g., manual_notes.risk, mileage artifacts) lack automated validation and could result in empty manifests.

## Next Steps
- Rewrite the parsing map markdowns to match the cataloged inputs, including toolkit/API triggers.
- Stage sample cases covering audio, mileage, and manual notes to validate the documented flows.
- Schedule follow-up review with DEESCALATION to confirm documentation before release.
