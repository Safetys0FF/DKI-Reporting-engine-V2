# POWER Agent Summary – toolkit & smoke readiness (2025-09-20)

## Work Completed
- Normalized mileage tool path: now resolves to `<repo>/artifacts/mileage` (override via `DKI_MILEAGE_DIR`), auto-creates folders, and respects custom directories.
- Hardened billing tool: initialized subcontractor totals/margins, reset notes per run, ensured `summary()` reads fallback-safe values.
- Guarded cochran match inputs: non-dict subject/candidate payloads now return REVIEW with explanatory reasoning instead of raising errors.
- Enhanced metadata tool: safe hash/metadata extraction with missing-file handling, new `collect_metadata` helper, and exposed `MetadataProcessor` class.
- Produced placeholder media/assets (JPEG/PNG/WAV/MP4/PDF/TXT) matching smoke bundle references; stubbed media engine inside `run_section_bundle_smoke.py` for deterministic runs.
- Re-ran section smoke harness (`SECTION_SMOKE_RESULTS_20250920_150929.json`) confirming all sections render with structured manifests.

## Artifacts
- `Report Engine/Tools/mileage_tool_v_2.py`
- `Report Engine/Tools/billing_tool_engine.py`
- `Report Engine/Tools/cochran_match_tool.py`
- `Report Engine/Tools/metadata_tool_v_5.py`
- `Report Engine/dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_bundle_smoke.py`
- `Report Engine/dev_tracking/logs/SECTION_SMOKE_RESULTS_20250920_150929.json`

## Outstanding Items
- Re-run DEESCALATION toolkit regression to verify WinError/attr errors are cleared.
- Decide whether to remove media stub once real assets are in place.
- Configure Tesseract PATH and evaluate tkinterdnd2 if drag-and-drop is required.
- Optional NLP dependencies (spacy/transformers/bs4) still pending.

## Next Actions (recommended)
1. DEESCALATION: rerun `TEST_RESULTS` sweep, validate mileage/billing/cochran/metadata now pass.
2. Stage full-fidelity media if available, then rerun smoke harness without stubs.
3. Update documentation (parsing maps already refreshed; add toolkit fixes to change logs if needed).
