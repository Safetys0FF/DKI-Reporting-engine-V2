# SMOKE VALIDATION â€” 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Run
- Command: `python run_dki_engine.py`
- Result: Launcher started, printed system info, and performed dependency checks.

Observations
- Logging: Clean ASCII output; no Unicode/Syntax crashes.
- Config: Defaults loaded from `dki_config.json`; validation not reached due to deps.
- Dependencies missing (required):
  - python-docx (`docx`)
  - openpyxl (`openpyxl`)
  - opencv-python (`cv2`)
  - reportlab (`reportlab`)
- Optional modules absent (FYI): pytesseract, openai, spacy, transformers, beautifulsoup4.

Outcome
- Smoke pre-check successful to the point of dependency verification.
- Engine halts gracefully with clear instructions to install missing packages.

Next
- NETWORK: Confirm installation of required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- After install, rerun smoke to generate CP/TOC + Section 1 and confirm 10-6/10-8 signaling.
