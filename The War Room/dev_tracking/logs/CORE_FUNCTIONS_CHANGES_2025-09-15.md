# CORE FUNCTIONS CHANGE RECORD â€” 2025-09-15 (Read-Only)

Summary
- Fixed startup logging and Unicode issues in `run_dki_engine.py`. Replaced corrupted strings and glyphs, corrected invalid f-strings, and ensured output is ASCII-safe.

Files Changed
- run_dki_engine.py
  - Removed non-ASCII glyphs in prints/logs that caused encoding failures.
  - Replaced invalid f-strings with valid, descriptive log messages.
  - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to file handler for robust logfile writing.
  - Normalized dependency and tool checks to use clear, non-symbolic messages.

Why
- Prior handshakes flagged a Unicode logging crash and startup instability. The script also contained broken f-strings that would result in a SyntaxError and/or UnicodeEncodeError.

Impact
- Startup script now logs and prints consistently without Unicode issues.
- Dependency checks and external tool checks report clearly.
- Unblocks basic startup validation once dependencies are installed.

Next Steps
- Coordinate with NETWORK to ensure required packages are installed (python-docx, openpyxl, opencv-python, reportlab).
- Proceed to Phase A standardization of the 12 core configs upon cross-agent confirmation.
- Prepare and run a minimal smoke test (CP/TOC + one section) once dependencies are in place.
