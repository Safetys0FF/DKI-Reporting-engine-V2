# STATUS UPDATE - 2025-09-19

- Date: 2025-09-19
- Active Agent: POWER (Codex)
- Change Summary: Completed Section Action Playbook coverage for sections 1-9 by enriching the gateway payload pipeline.
- Change Locations: `app/gateway_controller.py`
- Implementation Details: Added per-section payload builders, voice memo propagation, metadata/timeline synthesis helpers, and toolkit summary wiring so each section receives the ordered OCR/API/toolkit data required by the playbook.
- Impact: Section renderers now render structured content with far fewer placeholders, enabling downstream TOC/final assembly to operate on consistent manifests.
- Next Steps: 1) Run section smoke harness against a representative case bundle. 2) Capture updated manifests/screenshots for DEESCALATION regression notes.
