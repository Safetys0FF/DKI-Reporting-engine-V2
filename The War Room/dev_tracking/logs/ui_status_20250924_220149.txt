Professional Case Manager UI Status
===================================
Timestamp: 2025-09-24T22:01:49.410087

Summary:
- Identified `professional_case_manager.py` as the active Tkinter case-management interface with evidence-processing workflows and legitimate `main()` entry point.
- Other UI scripts (gui_main_application_clean.py, gui_main_application.py, gui_main_application_legacy.py, case_management_panel.py) are legacy shells or component panels without the incoming-evidence pipeline.
- `professional_case_manager.log` continues to capture runtime logging for the live UI.
