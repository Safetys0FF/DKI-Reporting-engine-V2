# POWER Change Summary - 2025-09-18

Purpose: Capture the single-file document processing addition and the DevTracking path bootstrap so NETWORK and DEESCALATION agents understand the new entry points and guardrails.

---

## What Changed
- `DocumentProcessor` now exposes a `process_file(...)` wrapper for single inputs.
- Helper `_infer_file_type(...)` determines the best-fit category when callers omit `file_type`.
- Added `dev_tracking/path_bootstrap.py` and updated smoke utilities to auto-insert the repo root on `sys.path`.
- Smoke/E2E harnesses revalidated against both additions.

## How It Changed
- `process_file(...)` accepts a path or metadata dict, normalizes required fields, infers type when missing, and then delegates to the existing `process_files([...])` pipeline.
- Aggregates the first entry from the bulk result back onto the returned payload (`file_id`, `file_result`, `text`, `processing_methods`) so downstream code keeps a simple contract.
- Added `_infer_file_type(...)` priority list to keep type assignment consistent with `supported_formats` definitions.
- Created `dev_tracking/path_bootstrap.py` to centralize path setup and injected the helper into POWER smoke utilities (`tools/e2e_smoke.py`, `tools/ai_osint_readiness.py`, `tools/import_keys_to_profile.py`, `agent_1_POWER_CODING/smoke_harness.py`, `agent_1_POWER_CODING/export_rtf_smoke.py`, `agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py`).
- Refresh scripts updated `dev_tracking/logs/*` to track the new capabilities (change log, progression log, file state metadata).

## Where (Files Updated/Added)
- Updated: `document_processor.py`
  - Added `_infer_file_type(...)` helper below the bulk processor.
  - Added `process_file(...)` wrapper that reuses `process_files` and returns consolidated results.
- Added: `dev_tracking/path_bootstrap.py` (shared helper for sys.path bootstrapping).
- Updated DevTracking utilities:
  - `dev_tracking/tools/ai_osint_readiness.py`
  - `dev_tracking/tools/e2e_smoke.py`
  - `dev_tracking/tools/import_keys_to_profile.py`
  - `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/smoke_harness.py`
  - `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/export_rtf_smoke.py`
  - `dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py`
- Updated logs:
  - `dev_tracking/logs/change_log.json` (entries for single-file wrapper and path bootstrap rollout)
  - `dev_tracking/logs/progression_log.json` (fix records for document processor + path bootstrap)
  - `dev_tracking/logs/file_states.json` (size/validation timestamp refresh)

## Verification (Key Results)
- Section smoke: `PYTHONPATH=... PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python test_section_smoke.py` (UTF-8 console still required for emoji output).
- End-to-end report: `PYTHONPATH=... PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python test_end_to_end_report.py`.
- Gateway E2E harness: `python dev_tracking/tools/e2e_smoke.py` (now runs without manual PYTHONPATH overrides).
- POWER smoke suite: `python dev_tracking/agent_1_POWER_CODING/run_section_smoke_all.py` (path bootstrap succeeds; execution currently stops when `UserProfileManager.save_api_key` is unavailable).

---

## Impacts / Guidance for Other Agents
- GUI and automation code can call `DocumentProcessor.process_file(...)` directly; no need to hand-build the list structure.
- Wrapper enforces file existence and keeps metadata normalized, reducing support noise for DEESCALATION validation runs.
- DevTracking utilities can now be invoked directly (`python dev_tracking/...`) without environment gymnastics; if additional scripts are added, import `bootstrap_paths` at the top.
- When OCR engines are not installed (e.g., Tesseract), results may mark `success=False`; rerun harnesses after installing optional engines if text extraction is required for a given workflow.
- If additional type categories are introduced, extend `_infer_file_type(...)` in priority order to keep routing deterministic, and register any new path-dependent scripts with `bootstrap_paths(...)`.

## OCR Path Review Findings - 2025-09-18
- document_processor.py:164 -> Lazy loader flips individual engine flags but leaves HAVE_OCR false; recompute availability after _load_ocr_modules succeeds so PDF/image handlers actually call _perform_ocr.
- document_processor.py:598 -> result.update(self._perform_ocr(...)) overwrites existing processing_methods; merge methods to keep metadata plus OCR audit trail.
- document_processor.py:599 -> Handler always appends tesseract_ocr even when EasyOCR or PaddleOCR succeeds; append the engine-specific tag based on engine_used instead.
- test_ocr_engines.py:131 and test_ocr_engines.py:219 -> Harness expects processor_result['ocr_results']; expose that summary from process_files or update the tests to read the per-file entry.
- document_processor.py:300 -> scan_results entries define ocr_text but nothing populates it; feed the OCR output into that field for downstream consumers.
---

## Evidence Pipeline Wiring - 2025-09-18
- Added `evidence_pipeline.EvidencePipeline` to generate manifests, route uploads, and persist intake snapshots before processing.
- `DocumentProcessor` now refreshes OCR availability on demand, preserves processing method provenance, and publishes per-file `ocr_results` plus `scan_results.ocr_text` summaries.
- `main_application.process_files` runs through the new pipeline, captures warnings, and feeds media analysis with normalized paths.
- Introduced `test_mixed_media_pipeline.py` regression harness; compiled key modules and executed the harness (passes). `test_simple_report.py` still fails without `moviepy` (unchanged upstream dependency).
