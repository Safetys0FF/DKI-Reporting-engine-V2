Next Steps / TODO (Evidence Locker → Section → Report Pipeline)

1. Manifest/Pool Persistence
   - Files: F:\The Central Command\Evidence Locker\evidence_locker_main.py, bus_extensions.py
   - Persist the normalized pool to the locker manifest (so restarts and non-GUI consumers can pull it).
   - Expose helper (get_structured_manifest / get_common_pool) for other modules and dashboards.

2. Section Controllers + Enrichment
   - Location: F:\The Central Command\Command Center\Data Bus\Bus Core Design (new controller module)
   - Subscribe to section.needs/evidence.deliver, pull entries from the common pool, run enrichment, emit section.data.updated back onto the bus.

3. Narrative Generation
   - Files: F:\The Central Command\Command Center\Mission Debrief\narrative_assembler.py, bus_core.py
   - Consume the enriched pool to generate real section narratives; push results into bus_core.section_data for GUI display.

4. Full Report Assembly/Export
   - Files: bus_core.py, mission_debrief_manager.py
   - Aggregate the narrative outputs, billing snapshots, disclosures; hand off to export routines (PDF/DOCX) and surface status in GUI.

5. Validation Suite
   - Files: F:\The Central Command\Command Center\UI\test_gateway_wiring.py (extend) + new end-to-end script in F:\The Central Command\The War Room\dev_tracking\
   - Automate ingest → section generation → full report → export to confirm the pool feeds every stage.
