# CORE FUNCTIONS CHANGE RECORD — 2025-09-14 (Read-Only)

Summary
- Scope: Stabilize dev-tracking module, remove broken glyphs/encodings, and correct a critical duplication in Section TOC config.
- Impact: Improves reliability of change logging and avoids config parse ambiguity in TOC gateway doc.

Changes Made
1) dev_tracker.py
   - Fixed invalid/garbled print strings and encoding artifacts.
   - Normalized context output (ASCII-only), replaced icon glyphs with plain markers: [OK], [PARTIAL], [MISSING].
   - Preserved APIs: DevTracker.scan_current_state, log_change, save_context_snapshot; ContextLoader.load_context_before_coding.
   - Rationale: Prior file contained broken f-strings and stray characters that would raise SyntaxError and corrupt outputs.

2) 2. Section TOC.txt
   - Removed a duplicated, out-of-context description block directly under `gateway_section_control` that repeated `linked_to` and `section_id`.
   - Rationale: Duplicate lines were not attached to a key, yielding invalid structure and potential parse failure.

Verification Notes
- dev_tracker.py now imports cleanly and prints stable, ASCII-only summaries.
- Section TOC top-level header renders without adjacent stray lines.

Deferred (Next Up)
- Standardize handler naming across configs (use `section_X_response_handler`).
- Consolidate duplicate `logic_switches` and endpoint blocks into single authoritative blocks per file.
- Review and normalize remaining 9 core engine configuration files (Sections 2–12) for the same patterns.
- Add a lightweight config validator (YAML/DSL) to CI or pre-run checks.
