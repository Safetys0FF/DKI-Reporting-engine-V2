# Central Command Integration Summary — 2025-09-25

## Work Completed
- Updated `enhanced_functional_gui.py` to build structured evidence payloads, retain case metadata, and forward enriched requests to `narrative.generate`. Added helper utilities for section titles, size formatting, and Data Bus signal subscriptions so GUI panes receive asynchronous status updates.
- Added `_register_bus_handlers` hook in the GUI state setup to log narrative and Mission Debrief events, plus evidence handoffs.
- Captured the integration blueprint in `Command Center/UI/GUI_BACKEND_WIRING_GUIDE.md`, outlining import path alignment, payload schemas, and validation steps tied to the Ops Center stress reports.

## Tests & Observations
- **Integration Harness (`integration_test.py`):** Evidence stored successfully, structured sections produced (`section_1`, `section_cp`, `section_dp`, `section_toc`, `section_3`, `section_5`, `section_8`), and `narrative.generate` returned case-aware text. `mission_debrief.process_report` still rejected the payload because Mission Debrief expects a dict-shaped `report_data`; no regression introduced.
- **Functional Evidence Flow (`test_functional_evidence.py`):** Passed end-to-end (ingest ? processing ? distribution ? narrative), confirming backend chains remain healthy after GUI wiring changes.
- **Performance Harness (`performance_test.py`):** Continues to fail; legacy mocks inside the script lack current CAN bus methods (`MockECC.can_run`, `MockBus.register_signal`) and dependencies like `libmagic`, matching the pre-existing stress report failures.

## Next Actions
1. Adjust Mission Debrief invocation to send section-by-section dict payloads and confirm successful `mission_debrief.*` bus events.
2. Modernize performance-test mocks (or swap in live ECC/Gateway instances) so the suite exercises the new signal architecture; install `libmagic` to restore file-type detection.
3. Promote the integration harness into an automated regression test and rerun the Ops Center stress suites once the above fixes land to capture post-wiring metrics.
