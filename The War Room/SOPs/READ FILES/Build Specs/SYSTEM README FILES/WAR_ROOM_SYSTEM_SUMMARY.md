# War Room System Summary

## Overview
The War Room is the operational sandbox for processors, SOPs, test artifacts, and integration telemetry that support the Central Command stack. It houses local processing engines, QA harnesses, configuration environments, and documentation that drive continuous validation across Evidence Locker, Gateway, SectionBusAdapter, Enhanced GUI, and Mission Debrief.

## Key Areas
- **Processors:** OCR, CV, NLP, and media tooling (Poppler, Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Whisper) used by Evidence Locker and Gateway pipelines.
- **SOP Repository:** Detailed playbooks (`SOPs/READ FILES/Build Specs`) describing system configurations, runbooks, and build steps (updated Phase 1–4 entries).
- **Dev Tracking:** Logs, integration reports, billing summaries, and analytics produced by the Analyst Deck and automated SectionBusAdapter tests.
- **Data & Environments:** Local `dki_env`, fixtures, disclosure catalogs, and sample evidence packages for replaying the full report workflow end-to-end.

## Recent Enhancements
- Documented the four-phase integration plan (classification routing, bus loop completion, section controllers, narrative alignment) and marked Phase 1–3 complete.
- Captured new telemetry feeds: locker dedupe metrics, SectionBusAdapter billing/analytics snapshots, and Librarian enrichment histories for QA baselines.
- Added disclosure catalogs and billing fixtures to the sandbox so GUI and Librarian validation scripts can replay final-assembly scenarios.

## Operational Role
- Acts as the staging ground for new tooling before promotion to shared environments.
- Supports QA and smoke-test suites that validate classification handoffs, request/deliver dedupe, enrichment timing, billing analytics, and mission status emissions.
- Provides reference documentation for onboarding, recovery workflows, regulatory disclosures, and cross-team coordination.

## Next Steps
- Expand SYSTEM README coverage for additional subsystems and SOP bundles as remaining phases land.
- Automate synchronization between War Room logs, Analyst Deck dashboards, and Warden mission status snapshots.
- Introduce automated environment health checks, dependency version tracking, and disclosure compliance linting.
